To install the certificate equifax_secure_certificate_authority.cer -

1. Run proenv

2. In the command line type: certutil -import "<the certificate file full path>"


Note: 

I have had problems using certutil and a certificate file path with spaces. I recommend using a file path with no spaces.

Depending on the OS you may need to restart your machine.
