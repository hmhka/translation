1
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:06,719
Today we have come here

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,926
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

3
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:19,051
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

4
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:26,051
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,010
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

6
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:36,843
in our futuristic planning,

7
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:43,135
or in our mental activities;

8
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:48,885
He gives us guidance and protection.

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,385
As you know that Germany is a place where

10
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:04,509
people are very active, very right-sided,

11
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:09,385
use their brain too much,

12
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:13,759
and they are very machine-oriented also.

13
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,635
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

14
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:23,343
who is an eternal child

15
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,759
– because He was like a monkey,

16
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,719
His head was that of a monkey,

17
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:33,885
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

18
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:39,051
and He was the one who was used

19
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:42,719
to run the right side of human beings.

20
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:49,135
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

21
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,926
To begin with He has to control the sun,

22
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:54,968
that the sun in the people,

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,552
if there is too much sun

24
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,302
then He must try to control it

25
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:04,051
and make it cooler, or smoother.

26
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:10,676
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

27
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:14,552
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

28
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,260
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

29
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,635
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

30
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,135
There He had to be told,

31
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:26,759
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

32
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:29,302
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

33
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:34,051
– because He thought that this sun

34
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:37,885
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

35
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:44,719
So the beauty of His character is that

36
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:50,801
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

37
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:55,885
has to control the right side,

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,885
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

39
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:05,469
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

40
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:08,260
They’re over-right-sided,

41
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:09,885
then even they get children,

42
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,343
but they are really not liked by the children

43
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:14,594
because they have no time for children,

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,093
they all the time are very strict with the children,

45
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:19,469
they shout them, shout at them,

46
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,719
they don’t know how to handle the children.

47
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:24,760
Or they’re over-indulgent,

48
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,552
because they always think that “I never got this,

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,885
so let me give it to the child.”

50
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:33,594
So these extreme type of people

51
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:38,343
who are right-sided

52
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,677
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

53
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:52,469
He is very anxious, very anxious

54
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,760
to do the work of Shri Rama.

55
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,469
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

56
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,010
which is full of balance, absolutely.

57
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:06,760
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

58
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,510
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

59
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:18,010
to do the work,

60
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:24,635
or to supply Him or to help Him

61
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,885
– like a secretary you can call Him;

62
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:31,759
and Shri Hanumana was the one

63
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,469
who was created for this purpose.

64
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,676
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

65
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:42,469
was such a assistant;

66
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:45,510
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

67
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,260
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

68
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,469
– even the servants, you see,

69
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:54,801
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

70
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,218
We can say like a dog or a horse,

71
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:06,385
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

72
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:14,676
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

73
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,719
navadha siddhis.

74
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:18,926
Nine siddhis He got.

75
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:25,801
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

76
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:30,010
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

77
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:34,385
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

78
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,385
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

79
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:40,885
There are nine siddhis that He got.

80
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,385
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

81
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:53,093
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

82
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:02,676
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

83
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,260
in his life?

84
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:08,719
What He does is to control his movement,

85
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,760
He makes him in such a way

86
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:15,719
that he has to put down his speed.

87
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,760
He makes his feet very heavy;

88
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:21,760
now he can’t do that much.

89
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:25,342
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

90
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,343
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

91
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:40,385
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

92
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:46,469
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

93
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,801
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

94
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:01,594
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

95
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,093
He has only one gadaa in His hand

96
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:11,801
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

97
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:16,343
and He can handle people with His tails,

98
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,218
He does not have to use His hand.

99
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:22,218
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

100
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,385
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

101
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,719
and sit on that.

102
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,426
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

103
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:33,260
as you’re to call them, you see,

104
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:37,260
and all these things He has within Himself

105
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,510
is to control a person

106
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,426
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

107
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,302
Then He can fly in the air.

108
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:54,177
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

109
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:56,510
but He can just fly in the air.

110
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,677
That means He can become so big

111
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:04,635
that the amount of air He displaces

112
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:09,301
has a much more weight than His own weight

113
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,385
– just the same principle Archimedes,

114
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:13,426
if you know the Archimedes principle

115
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,260
– that He becomes so big that His body

116
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,759
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

117
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,719
And He can fly in the air,

118
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:34,177
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

119
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:38,177
from one to another, through the ether.

120
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,260
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

121
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:49,093
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

122
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,552
He is the one who controls,

123
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:55,510
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

124
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,050
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

125
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,427
it communicates.

126
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,051
All the communications that you find,

127
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,759
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

128
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:11,385
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

129
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,177
is through Hanumana’s movement;

130
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:18,635
because He can go into a nirakar,

131
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,968
He can go into a formless state.

132
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:22,510
Also the communications,

133
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,719
we use it for this communication that we have,

134
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:30,385
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

135
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:34,302
but we have a television, we have got radios

136
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,051
and all those things.

137
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,510
Where we catch on to the ether,

138
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,093
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

139
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:47,968
and are available to people who are right-sided.

140
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:54,135
Only the right-sided people discover these things

141
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,801
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

142
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:03,385
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

143
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:08,469
where we don’t use any wires.

144
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:12,051
So without any connection through the ether,

145
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,427
He can manage.

146
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:20,051
So all the ethereal connections has been done

147
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:23,177
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

148
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:26,926
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

149
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:29,385
that you cannot challenge it,

150
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:31,177
and you cannot find faults with it.

151
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:33,801
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

152
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:37,510
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

153
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,302
He’s perfectly there.

154
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:42,510
Now the scientists discover it and think that

155
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:48,302
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

156
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,635
We say something in the ether

157
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,800
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

158
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,760
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

159
00:10:56,926 --> 00:11:00,843
we say something here or we relay something

160
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:04,635
on the television and it is seen the other side.

161
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,051
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

162
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:11,343
what is the way.

163
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:16,635
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

164
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:23,843
who has done such a beautiful network,

165
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:28,177
and through that network all these things work out.

166
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:32,051
So even on the right side

167
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:39,218
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

168
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:43,926
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

169
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,385
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

170
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:50,968
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

171
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,676
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

172
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,301
you all must be knowing about it.

173
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:58,677
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

174
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,760
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

175
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,302
nobody wants to find out,

176
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,218
because after all in an atom or...

177
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:10,051
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

178
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:14,427
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

179
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,760
So He has another great,

180
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:24,510
great siddhi which we call as anima.

181
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:28,177
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

182
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,385
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

183
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:35,594
or “renu” is the atom.

184
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,594
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

185
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,302
Now, many scientists think that they have,

186
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,010
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

187
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:47,510
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

188
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,177
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

189
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,135
so is already described there.

190
00:12:55,719 --> 00:13:00,635
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

191
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:05,010
the electromagnetic forces working,

192
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:09,135
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

193
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:14,260
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

194
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,385
So now we can see that as Ganesha

195
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:22,051
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

196
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,759
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

197
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:29,010
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

198
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,843
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

199
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:36,135
on the material side of it.

200
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:43,385
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

201
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:49,759
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

202
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,843
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

203
00:13:57,302 --> 00:14:02,469
of the different sides of our brain.

204
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,594
So how much He gives us.

205
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,926
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

206
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:13,510
then He gives us the power to think.

207
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:18,302
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

208
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,594
That is, we can say that,

209
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:25,801
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

210
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,135
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

211
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,260
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

212
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,260
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

213
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,302
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

214
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:46,135
But conscience is needed in a personality

215
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,593
where he is to be controlled,

216
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:54,177
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

217
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,801
which is the conscience in the human being.

218
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,051
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

219
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,177
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

220
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:09,051
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

221
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,593
means, “sat” means truth,

222
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:15,051
“asat” means untruth,

223
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:18,510
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

224
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,594
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

225
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:28,926
So, intelligence to discriminate between

226
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,593
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

227
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,551
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

228
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:45,968
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

229
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:47,510
He’s the adhyaksha,

230
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,635
means He is the – I call Him

231
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,093
as the chancellor of the university.

232
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,760
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

233
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:59,552
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

234
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:06,760
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

235
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,926
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

236
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:11,635
nirvichara samadhi

237
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:14,843
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

238
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,843
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

239
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:21,093
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

240
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:35,093
But the understanding that this is good,

241
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:38,426
this is for our benevolence,

242
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:46,759
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

243
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:50,968
And it’s very important for Western people

244
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,843
because it has to be mental,

245
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:55,176
otherwise they won’t understand.

246
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,760
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

247
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:00,301
It has to be mental.

248
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:05,635
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

249
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,676
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

250
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:13,635
Without Him, even if you become a saint

251
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,760
you will be – of course, you are a saint

252
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,676
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

253
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:24,302
but whether this saintliness is

254
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,843
all right if you live on Himalayas,

255
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,926
or is all right when you go across to people

256
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,051
to give them realization – all this scanning,

257
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,677
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

258
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:40,843
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

259
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:45,677
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

260
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,801
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

261
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,635
I should say, an essence of right side;

262
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:56,967
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

263
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:01,051
is important to get the protector of right side

264
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,760
here worshipped.

265
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:08,427
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

266
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:11,760
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

267
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:16,760
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

268
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:18,759
Now what is Shri Rama?

269
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:21,051
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

270
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:23,427
He works for the benevolence.

271
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,427
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

272
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:29,968
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

273
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,302
the English words are not so good to explain this,

274
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,635
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

275
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,051
who will not push forward Himself.

276
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:43,177
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

277
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:45,968
He is a very poised person.

278
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,842
So the Hanumana, you see,

279
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:53,552
He, He is the one who is always anxious

280
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,926
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

281
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,968
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

282
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:03,217
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

283
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:07,343
is the kind of a herb that was needed

284
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:10,427
to bring Lakshmana to life

285
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,302
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

286
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:17,218
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

287
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:21,092
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

288
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:26,677
And the discrimination in this is that,

289
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:29,093
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

290
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,092
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

291
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:34,677
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

292
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,843
like a guru and [*]shishya.

293
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,760
But even more than that, that the shishya

294
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:44,010
is just like a subservient servant,

295
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:47,343
absolutely surrendered to God,

296
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,843
absolutely surrendered to God,

297
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,302
and His main thing is surrender.

298
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:58,302
Now see, this surrender itself

299
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:01,968
shows that all those who are right-sided people

300
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:07,217
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

301
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,343
Mostly all those right-sided people

302
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:11,092
are very surrendered to their bosses,

303
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,302
surrendered to their jobs,

304
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:16,010
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

305
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:20,217
But they are subservient to wrong people,

306
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,594
they have no discretion.

307
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,427
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

308
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:28,468
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

309
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:31,217
then He tells you that you have to be

310
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:34,843
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

311
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,343
or to your Guru like Rama.

312
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,760
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

313
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:42,843
And then you are a free bird,

314
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,469
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

315
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:54,760
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

316
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,885
to antidote your too-much thinking,

317
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,635
to antidote your ego.

318
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:07,218
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

319
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:11,760
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

320
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:19,093
– is the capital of Ravana

321
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,843
– and the way He made fun of him.

322
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:25,677
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

323
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,010
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

324
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:34,427
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

325
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,842
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

326
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,468
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

327
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,177
and tickled his nose with His tail.

328
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,010
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

329
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:55,677
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

330
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,968
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

331
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,759
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

332
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,759
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

333
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,010
and has broken his crown.

334
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:08,217
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

335
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,177
to protect you from egoistical people.

336
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:14,967
And also He protects the egoistical people

337
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:19,759
by showing them down – like, say, Saddam.

338
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:23,801
In the case of Saddam I just asked Hanumana to do the job,

339
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,510
because I know He’ll do it.

340
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:29,135
Now, how He has put this Saddam

341
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:31,469
into different circumstances,

342
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,051
that he doesn’t know what to do,

343
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:36,677
he doesn’t know how to go.

344
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,885
Because supposing he says, “All right, I’ll have war”;

345
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:43,135
so the whole of Iraq will be finished,

346
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:44,594
he’ll be finished,

347
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,677
Kuwait will be finished, all petrol will be finished, all right.

348
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,260
Everybody will be in trouble.

349
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,343
But what about him? – he won’t be there, too.

350
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,510
Because if the Americans have to fight,

351
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,760
they will go in his place and fight.

352
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,385
They won’t fight in America,

353
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,594
he’s not going to go to America to fight them.

354
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,051
Few Americans may be dead.

355
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:06,260
So now, in this Saddam’s brain

356
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,385
also Hanumana is working and telling him,

357
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:14,010
“Now see, Mister, if you do like this, then this will happen.”

358
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:19,469
He works into the brains of all the politicians,

359
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,677
all these egoistical people.

360
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:26,093
And then, then they get sometimes stunned,

361
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:28,010
sometimes they change their policies,

362
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,260
they come round and that’s how they manage.

363
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:38,260
Also another great quality of Hanumana is that He makes,

364
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:43,885
makes people – sort of an arbitrator He is

365
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:46,801
– He makes people meet each other.

366
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,385
And two egoistical people,

367
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,885
He will make them meet,

368
00:23:51,093 --> 00:23:53,135
and then He’ll create such situation

369
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:56,093
that they both become friends and become mild.

370
00:23:56,343 --> 00:24:03,552
So His whole character within us acts us to see our ego,

371
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:07,677
discriminate that “Oh, this is my ego that is working,”

372
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:13,385
and then to become childlike and sweet,

373
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:15,217
mirthful and happy.

374
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:17,093
He’s always in a dancing mood,

375
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:18,885
all the time He’s dancing,

376
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:22,594
and before Rama He’s always bowed down,

377
00:24:22,926 --> 00:24:28,260
and always wants to do whatever is the desire of Shri Ram.

378
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,552
So if Ganesha stands behind Me,

379
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,926
Hanumana stands here at My feet,

380
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,385
and He’s there.

381
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:40,010
In the same way I would say, if Germany – as Philip,

382
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,594
he has asked Me that if

383
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:47,926
Germany can become like Hanumana

384
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:50,469
– then what a dynamic force we have,

385
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:53,135
if they become so subservient.

386
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:58,385
And the subservient nature of Hanumana

387
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,677
is seen to such an extent that,

388
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,719
as you know the story of Sita

389
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,594
when She gave a necklace to Him

390
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:09,718
and He wouldn’t wear it, because inside there was no Ram.

391
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:14,177
Once, Sita felt that all the time He is around,

392
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:19,217
and so He’s sort of cutting out Her privacy.

393
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:24,552
So She said, “Now, You can be there only for one work.

394
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,218
You need not to do every work.”

395
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:27,760
He used to do every work of Shri Rama.

396
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:29,885
She said, “For one work You should be there.

397
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,343
Choose whichever work You want to do.”

398
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:36,759
He said, “Only, you see, I would like to be with Shri Ram,

399
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:40,177
that whenever He sneezes I should do like this.”

400
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:41,635
You see, in India when we sneeze,

401
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,968
we have to do like this with this;

402
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:45,469
because the sneezing is, you see, avoids,

403
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,760
to avoid all the negativity to go out.

404
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:51,635
So we do like this if you sneeze.

405
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:57,968
Or if you feel sleepy

406
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:03,552
and you yawn, then also we do like that, mostly.

407
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:08,385
So He said, “Whenever He’ll yawn, You allow Me just to...”

408
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,843
– this we call as chutki,

409
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,427
I don’t know what you call this, chutki –

410
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:14,427
“allow Me to do this.”

411
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:17,051
Sita said, “This is something very little work,

412
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,260
you see, this fellow then will be out of sight.”

413
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:20,801
So He stood there.

414
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,177
So She said, “Now, why are You standing here?”

415
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,552
“I am waiting for that.

416
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:32,302
So how can I go?”

417
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,801
And that’s how – She granted, first She granted,

418
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,260
“All right, given to You this job,”

419
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,260
now She can’t take it back because She’s granted this job.

420
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:44,135
So He’s always there like this standing,

421
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,718
just to do this to Shri Ram.

422
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:49,385
So I mean, the sweetness of the whole thing

423
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:54,968
is that every time, every minute He is subservient,

424
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:58,260
He’s attentive, He’s there.

425
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:03,385
Also in Sahaja Yoga

426
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:11,759
I have relationships with you as a Guru, as a Mother

427
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,135
and, I don’t know, unlimited.

428
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:22,427
But still these two relationships we know of,

429
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:24,926
that I’m your Mother and I’m your Guru.

430
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,051
Now My – as a Guru,

431
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:31,510
My main concern is that

432
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:34,842
you should learn all about Sahaja Yog,

433
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,635
you should become experts of Sahaja Yoga,

434
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:41,385
and you should become yourself the gurus.

435
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,552
It’s the only concern I have.

436
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:46,385
But for that, complete surrender is required.

437
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:48,302
“Islam” means surrender.

438
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,926
So you have to surrender.

439
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:51,593
If you are surrendered,

440
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,842
then only you can learn what is the,

441
00:27:55,135 --> 00:28:01,843
what is the way you will handle Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:04,719
Now, even this surrendering

443
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,427
is done by Shri Hanumana.

444
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,885
He’s the one who teaches you how to surrender now

445
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:13,302
or makes you surrender,

446
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:16,552
because egoistical people don’t surrender.

447
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,635
Then He puts some sort of hurdles

448
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,635
or some sort of miracles or some tricks,

449
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:32,760
by which then a disciple surrenders himself to the Guru.

450
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:34,552
Otherwise he’s not surrendered,

451
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,759
he finds it difficult to surrender,

452
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:43,552
and the force that acts to make him surrender to the Guru

453
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:46,342
is also that of Hanumana.

454
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,218
So not that He is only surrendered,

455
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:53,177
but He makes others also to be surrendered.

456
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:56,302
Because only the – because of ego you cannot surrender,

457
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,552
so He’s the one who fights your ego,

458
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:04,677
and He puts it down and makes you surrender.

459
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,968
So in His own expression,

460
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:14,759
I would say that what He has shown that

461
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:20,218
there’s a very beautiful area of right side.

462
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:24,677
If it is to be perfectly enjoyed

463
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:28,968
then you should be completely surrendered to your Guru,

464
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,760
as if you are the servant of that Guru.

465
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:37,801
Whatever you have to do for that Guru,

466
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:38,968
you have to do it.

467
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,967
Of course, you must know that your Guru

468
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:43,510
has to give you realization, minimum,

469
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,719
otherwise that’s not a guru.

470
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:48,926
But anybody who has given you the realization,

471
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
you have to be so surrendered

472
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,759
that you should be just like a servant,

473
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,718
not to feel shy about it.

474
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:57,302
Like I would now sometimes,

475
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,385
you know, I am going by, say,

476
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:02,427
I’m going by aeroplane,

477
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:07,135
and sometimes I cannot wear My shoes

478
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:09,510
because they’re so swollen up.

479
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:12,385
So normally I would take the shoes in My hands

480
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:13,968
and walk about.

481
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:15,759
But I have seen Sahaja yogis,

482
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:17,926
they pick up My shoes also and walk with it,

483
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:20,302
and they don’t feel shy about it.

484
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,718
They just feel so proud that they are carrying My shoes.

485
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,635
So there is not

486
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:29,177
– one should feel proud that you are doing all these things,

487
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:32,926
that you have a chance to do all these things for your Guru,

488
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:36,510
and that you are surrendering to that Guru;

489
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:39,427
you are absolutely only bothered

490
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,719
as to how you can serve the Guru,

491
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,427
how you can please the Guru,

492
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,635
and how you could be closer to that Guru.

493
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:50,510
It doesn’t mean physical closeness

494
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:54,926
but a kind of a rapport, a kind of an understanding.

495
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:58,801
Even those who are away from Me can feel Me in their heart.

496
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,968
And this is what it is, that

497
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,759
we have to get this power from Shri Hanumana.

498
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,719
Now, He’s the one who protects also all the deities.

499
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,135
He protects. Now, there’s a difference

500
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:18,385
between Shri Ganesha and Him.

501
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:23,552
The Shri Ganesha gives energy shakti,

502
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,759
but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana.

503
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,718
So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna

504
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:33,177
was the chariot of Arjuna,

505
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:37,635
then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana,

506
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,385
not Shri Ganesh.

507
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:43,051
Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him.

508
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:48,843
Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu,

509
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:51,510
so He has to look after Him.

510
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:54,801
He is an angel, as you know:

511
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:59,302
according to Christian, we should say according to Bible,

512
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,843
that He is the angel called Gabriel.

513
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:08,801
Now Gabriel is the one who brought the message,

514
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:13,302
because He’s always a messenger, to Maria,

515
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:16,926
and it’s surprisingly the words He used were

516
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,968
“Immaculata Salve” – that’s My name.

517
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,635
My first name is Nirmala,

518
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:26,135
means “Immaculata” and surname is Salve.

519
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,260
He said those words to Her.

520
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:31,302
And today also I was surprised

521
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:35,260
when it came to giving Me a present,

522
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:39,302
they found a tea-set and dinner-set

523
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:41,510
which is called as “Maria.”

524
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:46,510
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumana all Her life.

525
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,385
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.

526
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:54,385
Mahalakshmi being the Sita, Sita then Radha,

527
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:57,801
Hanumana has to be there to serve Her.

528
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:01,552
And that is why, you see, sometimes

529
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:05,177
people say, “Mother, how did You know?

530
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:07,510
Mother, how did You come to know?

531
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:11,427
Mother, how did You send a message?

532
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,427
Mother, how did You work it out?” Can you imagine?

533
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:18,968
This is Shri Hanumana’s headache, He does it.

534
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:21,385
Anything passes through My mind,

535
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:23,177
He just takes it up and it’s done.

536
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:26,635
Because as I told you that His whole organization

537
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:28,510
is so well planned;

538
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,843
all these messages, from where do they get them?

539
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,051
Many people say, “Mother, I just prayed to You.”

540
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,385
There was a gentleman

541
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:37,051
whose mother was very sick

542
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:38,759
and he went to see her,

543
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,801
and she was just going to die with cancer.

544
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,719
So he said, “I didn’t know what to do,

545
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:45,801
so I just prayed to You,

546
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:47,801
"Mother, please save my mother.”

547
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,759
Now the sincerity of that person,

548
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:54,926
the depth of that person as a Sahaja yogi Hanumana knows.

549
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,135
He knows what is the weight of this person is.

550
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,051
And immediately, you’ll be surprised,

551
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,719
within three days the woman who was going to die survived,

552
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:05,842
she got all right.

553
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:08,427
He brought her to Bombay and the doctor said,

554
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:10,510
“She has no cancer.”

555
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,634
Many things which you call miracles

556
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,177
are done by Shri Hanuman.

557
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,177
He’s the one who is the doer of miracles.

558
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:25,719
He does miracles also to show how stupid you are,

559
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:28,594
how foolish you are,

560
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:31,759
because He is on the right side,

561
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:33,759
see He goes to the ego side.

562
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:36,594
Now with the ego a human being

563
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:40,759
is always becomes stupid – that’s, I mean, inevitable.

564
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:44,259
With ego they become so stupid, “Oh, what’s wrong?”

565
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,427
And that’s why you will find

566
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,260
many people doing such stupid things,

567
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,801
we can’t understand why they do it.

568
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,010
They say, “What’s wrong?”

569
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,427
What’s wrong is that Hanumana doesn’t like it is the point,

570
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,801
and then it recoils.

571
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:02,719
When they act stupidly it recoils

572
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:06,719
and then they know that we have done such a big mistake,

573
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,759
or it was all stupid.

574
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:13,009
But sometimes it could be extremely, extremely

575
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:17,051
difficult to retrace back;

576
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:21,719
like the diseases, as I call it the yuppies disease,

577
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:23,177
which is now impossible

578
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:25,177
because Hanumana has taken away

579
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,594
the electromagnetic force

580
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,801
from these people and it doesn’t work,

581
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:30,719
it doesn’t relate to your conscious mind.

582
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:33,594
So your conscious mind cannot act, it just goes off.

583
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,719
Only these people, if they worship Hanumana

584
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,302
with the same devotion, then maybe they might be saved.

585
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:44,302
But it’s not a easy thing to convince these stupid yuppies,

586
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:45,759
you see, about anything.

587
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:48,176
They say, “We don’t believe. So what?”

588
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:49,926
So what, you die – what else?

589
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:55,260
That’s the only limit, that’s the only life left for you,

590
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:57,177
and you do that.

591
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:00,801
There are so many aspects of Hanumana

592
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:03,801
which I could have told you;

593
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:07,843
but for example, for His body,

594
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:11,385
you see, like Shiva is covered with the gheru.

595
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:14,135
What you call gheru is a,

596
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:17,009
that’s a kind of a, you know that gheru is,

597
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,801
it’s a red-colored stone which is very, very, it is very hot.

598
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:25,843
And supposing with the cold

599
00:36:26,135 --> 00:36:29,759
sometimes you develop those rashes,

600
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,719
so if you put gheru those rashes are corrected.

601
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:35,259
Or you get, due to badha sometimes,

602
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,719
some sort of skin-diseases which are cured with gheru;

603
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:41,384
because it is the one which is very hot,

604
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:42,968
and it soothes you down.

605
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,551
On the contrary Shri Ganesha

606
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,677
is covered with lead oxide,

607
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:52,177
with the red lead oxide which is,

608
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,010
which is extremely cold.

609
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:59,010
Lead oxide is a very cold thing.

610
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,759
If you touch lead, you see, it’s a very cold thing.

611
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:05,968
So that lead oxide is used to cover all His body,

612
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:12,343
is there to balance the heat that He has,

613
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:14,677
or the effects of heat He has.

614
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:19,469
So we call this in Sanskrit language is called as sindhura,

615
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:22,469
and also in Marathi or Hindi called shindhura.

616
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:26,010
So they must find always this is the color of that thing;

617
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:32,218
so luckily I got this sari in Vienna,

618
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:37,010
and I have it very nice for this occasion.

619
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:40,552
So He’s always covered with that color,

620
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,759
what you call this sindhur color.

621
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:49,552
And lead oxide, though they say it causes cancer,

622
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:52,677
people say that lead oxide can cause you cancer;

623
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:56,218
but it is the lead oxide which is very cold,

624
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:58,010
it can cool you down so much

625
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:00,093
that you can go to the left side.

626
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:02,469
And cancer is a psychosomatic disease,

627
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,552
and that might be the reason it might cause,

628
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,968
in a very far-fetched way we can say,

629
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,426
can cause cancer to you.

630
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:12,968
Because if it is too cold and all that

631
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:15,218
and then you go to the left side,

632
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,177
and the left side you can catch the viruses,

633
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:21,010
by which you can get into troubles.

634
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:25,427
So, but the same lead oxide is all right for people

635
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,051
who are very right-sided.

636
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:33,260
For them if it is put on their Agnya it cools them down,

637
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,719
they are cooled down.

638
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:38,134
And it’s very good for them to put on their Agnya,

639
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,635
so that they are cooled down.

640
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:42,551
Their anger goes down, their temper goes down,

641
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:44,759
and it’s a very good thing.

642
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:47,759
So He’s the one who cures our anger,

643
00:38:47,968 --> 00:38:53,426
He’s the one who cures our hastiness,

644
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:56,801
our speediness,

645
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,552
our aggressiveness.

646
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:01,719
He’s the one who does it.

647
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:04,384
Now, He played a trick on Hitler. How?

648
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:09,510
Hitler was using Shri Ganesha as a symbol,

649
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:14,510
so this swastika was made in a clockwise manner.

650
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:16,968
Then Hanumana played a trick on him.

651
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,510
What He did, He made the

652
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:26,510
stencil which they were using for making the,

653
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:31,594
what you call the, making the swastika.

654
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:36,469
He put it, somehow or other, lot of – I mean,

655
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,177
He made it in such a way that they said,

656
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:40,594
“We should use the other side.”

657
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:44,759
As soon as they used the other side – it’s Hanumana’s trick;

658
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,051
I suggested to Him, but I mean, He played the trick

659
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,759
– they started using Ganesha from the other side.

660
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:55,469
The same Ganesha about whom

661
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,926
Shri Hanumana was worried how will He,

662
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:02,385
how can He surpass Shri Ganesha,

663
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:06,385
because He is the eldest, and how can you go beyond Him?

664
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:10,552
And He is the deity, but Hanumana is an angel.

665
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:14,176
So as soon as the trick was played,

666
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:19,385
then both of them put together stopped Hitler from winning.

667
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,968
This is how the trick was played.

668
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:25,759
So all these little, little tricks, you see, are there.

669
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,926
Once I remember I had My Puja in Germany;

670
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:34,427
and Germany is the place where these tricks are played

671
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,302
very much by Hanumana,

672
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:39,177
because I have told you that they are the ones

673
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:40,759
who require Him the most.

674
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:43,801
So there was in Germany, there was a puja,

675
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:47,676
and in the puja by mistake they put it the other way round

676
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:49,384
– by mistake.

677
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:52,926
I didn’t see. I, normally I always watch very carefully,

678
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,302
but I don’t know why, that day I didn’t see it:

679
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,385
it must be also Hanumana’s trick.

680
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,510
And when I saw, I said,

681
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,677
“Oh God, where is it going to now hurt?

682
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:04,759
Where is it going to work out?

683
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:07,051
Which country it is going to hit?”

684
00:41:07,302 --> 00:41:13,427
It did not hit Germany, it hit England.

685
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:16,759
Because England, I have worked so hard there

686
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:19,427
and they have been so negligent about Sahaja Yoga,

687
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:23,427
so lethargic about it, that it just went and hit there.

688
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:28,968
So He is the one who goes like a torrential rain,

689
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,760
or can go like a speedy, very speedy

690
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,051
tempest and destroy things.

691
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,051
So He works out all these things

692
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:40,385
through His electromagnetic forces.

693
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:45,510
So all the matter, all the matter

694
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,051
is under His control.

695
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:50,510
All the matter is under His control,

696
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:54,177
and He’s the one who creates rain for you,

697
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:56,093
who creates sun for you,

698
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,135
He creates breeze for you.

699
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,801
He’s the one who does all these things

700
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:03,801
just to have a proper puja,

701
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,843
to have a proper meeting,

702
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,759
everything He works out so beautifully.

703
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:11,968
And nobody even knows that it is Shri Hanumana

704
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:12,843
who has done it,

705
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:16,719
and we should thank Shri Hanumana all the time.

706
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:19,218
For the today’s thing, I mean, there are

707
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:22,760
– I, if I have to talk about Him I’ll take hours together.

708
00:42:23,218 --> 00:42:27,634
But only thing I have to say that it’s a,

709
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:31,968
such a blessing, I feel, that we have this in this palace,

710
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:34,634
Shri Hanumana’s Puja.

711
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:45,677
Because He was always a very majestic deity or a angel,

712
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:51,051
and that in a place where it is so majestic

713
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:53,676
and beautifully done, everything is there,

714
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,634
and He would like that.

715
00:42:55,843 --> 00:43:00,051
He is not a sanyasi type of a person,

716
00:43:00,218 --> 00:43:01,176
He’s not an ascetic.

717
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:03,594
Normally right-sided people are ascetic,

718
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:07,635
they become..., they’ll make right-sided people,

719
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:10,759
they’ll only have everything simple.

720
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,469
They would like to shave off their nose also if possible,

721
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,677
on the faces!

722
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:20,343
So you see, the other way round, Hanumana is not doing.

723
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:24,885
Hanumana likes beauty, He likes decorativeness,

724
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:29,009
and He makes people non-ascetic,

725
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:33,093
so Hanumana gives you this kind of a thing.

726
00:43:33,427 --> 00:43:36,010
But many people who are worshippers of Hanumana

727
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:39,759
always say that those ladies should never go

728
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:42,343
and take the darshan of Hanuman,

729
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:45,093
because Hanumana is a brahmachari

730
00:43:45,635 --> 00:43:49,677
– is the one who is, who doesn’t want women to see him

731
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:52,427
because he doesn’t wear full clothes

732
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,343
– and He has very little clothes on Himself,

733
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,427
so He doesn’t want women to see Him.

734
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,302
But if women think He is just a child,

735
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:01,760
then it’s just the same.

736
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:05,551
But this idea I think the people don’t have,

737
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,760
that He’s a child.

738
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,343
What is for a child how many clothes he wear

739
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:10,218
or doesn’t wear?

740
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:11,343
And then He’s a monkey,

741
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:13,010
and the monkeys are not supposed to wear clothes.

742
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:15,302
So whatever He wears is quite a lot,

743
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:18,010
and it doesn’t give you even the feeling at all that

744
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:20,218
He’s in any way nude or anything,

745
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,885
but you just see such a sweet form of Him,

746
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,469
such a sweet form.

747
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:28,385
I wish sometimes you’d get His photograph also,

748
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:33,552
as you have got the photographs of Shri Ganesha.

749
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,843
Then you’ll really fall in love with Him,

750
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:36,926
He’s such a sweet thing.

751
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,719
And though He is so huge and so big

752
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,926
and though He has nails,

753
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:46,635
but when He caresses My feet He pulls back His nails.

754
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:50,051
He is so gentle, extremely gentle,

755
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:53,260
and very beautifully He caresses My feet.

756
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,635
And I have seen Him the way He handles everything,

757
00:44:56,843 --> 00:44:58,843
it’s extremely gentle ways.

758
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:00,302
So that’s what I feel,

759
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:02,510
that now Germans are becoming very gentle

760
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:05,719
in handling things, in handling people.

761
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:08,301
This change is coming, and I think

762
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,759
is the blessing of Hanumana on them.

763
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:14,134
So may God bless you.

764
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:24,759
Now, so today we need not do Ganesh Puja,

765
00:45:25,093 --> 00:45:30,009
though a … once you can wash My feet with some song;

766
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:32,135
because always before every puja

767
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:36,719
one has to do Ganesha Puja, but need not be that elaborate.

768
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,635
Just – where is Barbara?

769
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,759
Ask her to get some hot water bottle,

770
00:46:15,926 --> 00:46:17,926
because Ganesha is cooling Me,

771
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:21,177
the – and Hanumana is cooling Me down completely.

772
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:24,135
It’s Hanumana, you see,

773
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:26,510
is cooling Me down completely here from the back,

774
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:29,926
and just now see how cool it’s becoming, the whole place,

775
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:32,759
talking about Him.

776
02:03:41,218 --> 02:03:45,635
This is the present from Russia

777
02:03:46,093 --> 02:03:49,968
and here, see now, the color of Hanumana

778
02:03:50,218 --> 02:03:52,093
is exactly like My sari.

779
02:03:52,968 --> 02:03:55,968
And this is Hanumana, the Gabriel, just imagine:

780
02:03:56,218 --> 02:03:58,885
this is a Russian folk story,

781
02:03:59,177 --> 02:04:04,552
so Russians knew that He used to wear clothes of this color

782
02:04:04,843 --> 02:04:06,218
– just imagine.

783
02:04:06,635 --> 02:04:11,010
And He’s sitting on a horse,

784
02:04:11,677 --> 02:04:15,968
and also it is said that it is Gabriel

785
02:04:16,177 --> 02:04:22,427
who told Mohammed Sahib about the seven...

786
02:04:26,635 --> 02:04:30,427
He gave a horse to Mohammed Sahib

787
02:04:30,635 --> 02:04:36,051
to see to seven Heavens, you see, He gave.

788
02:04:37,010 --> 02:04:40,719
Yes, to see God Almighty on His greatness,

789
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:42,343
that is the seven chakras,

790
02:04:42,677 --> 02:04:44,427
so Hanumana gave Him.

791
02:04:45,343 --> 02:04:46,885
It’s correct.

792
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:49,594
Because Mohammed Sahib was on the left-hand side,

793
02:04:49,801 --> 02:04:53,760
He had a Chandra Ma; so He gave Him.

794
02:04:54,885 --> 02:04:57,260
So this is a beautiful piece.

795
02:04:57,968 --> 02:05:00,343
You should keep it there...

796
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:05,218
But it’s made in Germany, made in Germany.
