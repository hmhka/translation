00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:48,528
?Shri Ekadasha Rudra Puja. Faggeto Lario, Como (Italy), 16 September 1984.

2
00:00:48,528 --> 00:01:03,751
Today, we are doing a special type of puja which is performed in the glory of Ekadasha Rudra.
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of the Spirit.

3
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,513
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of the Spirit.

4
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:14,122
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

5
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:18,813
He forgives, because we are human beings, we commit mistakes,

6
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:22,139
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

7
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:30,942
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives us.

8
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:38,691
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity, we do immoral things,

9
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:47,952
we do thieving, and we do things that are against God, talk against Him.

10
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:57,783
He also forgives our superficialities, jealousies, our lust, our anger.

11
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:15,751
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies, vanities and also possessiveness.

12
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:26,030
He forgives our egoistical behaviour and also our subordination to wrong things.

13
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,248
But every action has a reaction, and when He forgives,

14
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:39,191
He thinks that He has given you a big grace-mark,

15
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:47,256
and that reaction builds up within Him as a wrath,

16
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:59,000
against those who are forgiven,[who] try to do greater mistakes.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,783
Specially, after realisation,

18
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:09,280
because such a big blessing there is of the realisation –  you’ve got the light and, in the light,

19
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:21,248
if you are holding onto a snake then His wrath goes up because he sees how stupid you have been.

20
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:25,331
(Italian translator is confused so Mother re-iterates)

21
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,638
What I am saying is that after realisation, specially,

22
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,331
He is much more sensitive that,

23
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:35,014
people who are forgiven and have been given such a big thing like Self-realisation,

24
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:39,794
still they do wrong things then he is much more wrathful.

25
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:47,110
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts reducing and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

26
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:56,656
But when He forgives and, as a result of that forgiveness you feel the gratitude,

27
00:03:56,656 --> 00:04:01,218
then His blessings start flowing towards you.

28
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:05,421
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive others.

29
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:10,800
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust, He pacifies your greed.

30
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,983
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come on our being and we become really beautiful flowers,

31
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:28,998
and we start shining in the sunshine of His blessings.

32
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:39,940
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

33
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,775
He protects realised souls at every point, in every way.

34
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:57,764
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi but they are all neutralised by His tremendous power of protection.

35
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:03,389
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided into right path.

36
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:16,983
All the beautiful blessings of His are described in the Psalm 23 isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

37
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,390
The Lord is my Shepherd” Is all described how he looks after you as a shepherd.

38
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,610
But He does not look after the evil people He destroys them.

39
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,624
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are still carrying on with their evil nature are destroyed.

40
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:35,922
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate and do not rise He destroys,

41
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:38,223
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

42
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:46,483
Those who murmur against God and live in a way that is not behoving a sahaja yogi,

43
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,280
He removes them from [it].

44
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,598
So by one force, He protects, by another force, He throws away.

45
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:56,091
But His destructive forces when they are built up too much,

46
00:05:56,091 --> 00:06:03,982
then we call it – now the Ekadasha Rudra is active.

47
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:11,007
Now, this Ekadasha Rudra will be expressed when the Kalki itself will start acting,

48
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:18,752
means the destructive power which will destroy all that is negative on this earth and save all that is positive.

49
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:24,623
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis to expedite their ascent,

50
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:31,466
not to be satisfied with the social life or married life or

51
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:36,107
with all the blessings that God has bestowed upon you.

52
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:41,030
We always see, what God has done for us, how He has been miraculous to us,

53
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,766
but we have to see what we have done to ourselves,

54
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:48,373
what are we doing about our own ascent and growth.

55
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:54,485
Now the…out of the eleven centres…… Ekadasha, means eleven,

56
00:06:54,485 --> 00:07:06,216
the five come from the right side of your void, and five from the left side of your void.

57
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:09,794
The first five on the left hand side come from:

58
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:17,486
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus, or if you have read wrong books,

59
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:21,750
or if you have been in the company of wrong people,

60
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,111
or if you have been sympathetic towards people who have been following wrong paths,

61
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:35,029
or you have been yourself one of the agents or guru of these wrong people.

62
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:48,725
Now these five problems can be solved, if we completely give up whatever wrong we have been doing.

63
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:56,547
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to beat the Shaitan, means the Satan, with shoes;

64
00:07:56,547 --> 00:08:01,033
but that has to be done not mechanically but from your heart.

65
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:04,500
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will tell me,

66
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,631
“My father is following this guru; that father is following that guru,”

67
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:13,013
and get involved with their father, mother, sister, this,

68
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:19,609
that and try to take them out from those gurus, also get entangled.

69
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:26,577
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

70
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:32,108
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

71
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:37,264
and her parents and parents-in-law said that the child must be baptised,

72
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,486
and I told her, you cannot get this child baptised because it’s a realised soul.

73
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,582
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,

74
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:51,435
and she took the child for baptism and the child became very funny – it was really like a mad child.

75
00:08:51,435 --> 00:09:08,770
Now then she gave up all that and so she has saved.

76
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,716
But supposing she had another child and she would have done the same thing,

77
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:17,170
the second child would have been something very, very bad.

78
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:26,173
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is that anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

79
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:32,544
Either you should have very strong sensitivity, or you should feel it in your body,

80
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:38,061
or with your intelligence you should understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

81
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:43,190
A person who is still negative always gets attracted towards another one who is a very,

82
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:52,001
very powerfully negative and does not understand that the other person is so powerfully negative, but gets impressed.

83
00:09:52,001 --> 00:10:03,779
Under such circumstances, such a person is hit by that negative person and Shiva cannot protect.

84
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,059
One should not have sympathy with anyone who is negative, whether he is mad,

85
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:14,076
whether there is something wrong with him, whether he is your relation, or anything.

86
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:21,660
No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a kind of a anger should be there for that person,

87
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,840
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

88
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,225
And this angry detachment is the only time when you have to be angry.

89
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:38,372
But I have seen people who have anger for very good sahaja yogis

90
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:44,920
but not for their own husbands or wives who are extremely negative.

91
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:53,936
So when the Ekadasha Rudra starts acting on these five sides on the, we should say,

92
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:58,857
on the right side it moves, because it comes from the left and moves to the right side,

93
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:11,294
then a person starts becoming also negative but acting with his ego.

94
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:15,940
Such a person may take up a situation into hands and say that

95
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,888
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am so, we should do like this and we should behave like this”,

96
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:25,269
and start dictating people. [They] can do anything.

97
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:30,675
And some mediocres or some half-baked sahaja yogis may try to understand [him],

98
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:37,215
but most of them will know that, “This fellow is going out, now he’s on his way out!”

99
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:45,188
So, all these things lead to this left side development, or we can call it on the head,

100
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:54,827
on the right hand side of your medha, this plate, brain-plate is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

101
00:11:54,827 --> 00:12:04,998
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea people have that, “I am myself a big guru.”

102
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:12,608
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also, as if they have become great gurus.

103
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:18,231
We have known some people who give big lectures in any programme

104
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:21,255
and never allow my tape to be played or anything.

105
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:24,655
They think they have now become experts.

106
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:32,747
Then some of them say that now we have become so great that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

107
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:36,521
there’s no need to do meditation –  there are some like that also.

108
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:40,592
And then there are some who say that sin can never touch us,

109
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:46,873
now we are sahaja yogis, we are very great evolved souls.

110
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:50,646
But the worst of all are those who just take my name saying that

111
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,549
“Mother has said so and I am telling you because Mother has said” –

112
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:58,846
when I have never said such a thing, is all falsehood.

113
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:05,700
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga money and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way,

114
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,126
exploit them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

115
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:13,863
And such people become very inauspicious.

116
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:19,333
Anyone who tries such things will go out of Sahaja Yoga with disgrace.

117
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,169
But one should never go near such a person,

118
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,844
have nothing to do with such a person, have no sympathies.

119
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:32,967
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone to any extent, so better keep out of such people.

120
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:38,375
When these ten Ekadashas are developed within a person,

121
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:45,865
then definitely such a person gets diseases like cancer and incurable horrible diseases.

122
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:51,124
Specially, when the eleventh one which is actually here,

123
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:56,779
which is the Virata’s chakra, which is the collectivity –

124
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,250
when it is affected as well, then such a person cannot get out of this disease.

125
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:11,892
But these…out of these even five are combined, supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

126
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:16,952
then they get into very serious type of dirty diseases.

127
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:22,294
That’s why, I always say that be careful about your Agnya chakra,

128
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:32,062
because that is one of the worst things, that, once it starts getting combined with these Ekadashas,

129
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:35,394
part of the Ekadashas, then anything can happen to a person,

130
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:43,390
he can meet with a horrible accident, he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be murdered by someone,

131
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:52,768
anything can happen to such a person who has got the right Agnya and also any one of the Ekadashas, right or left.

132
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:59,421
That means, the five of these, if they, any one of the five,

133
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:06,765
if they combine with Agnya Chakra, the protective powers of God are minimum.

134
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:14,315
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright, say now I am speaking, now you should watch Me constantly,

135
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:24,028
so that there is thoughtless awareness and the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

136
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:28,488
But, don’t pay attention here and there all the time.

137
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:38,327
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention will neutralise into thoughtless awareness,

138
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:52,312
and your attention would be fixed in such a manner that you don’t have to worry about anything.

139
00:15:52,312 --> 00:16:02,935
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch you, that’s your fortress.

140
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:19,330
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless awareness, that is the sign that you are rising higher.

141
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,560
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright, Mother we are doing.”

142
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,481
Mechanically, they do and say, “I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

143
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:35,602
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness, minimum of minimum?

144
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:42,951
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out of your head?

145
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:50,717
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically, it is not going to help; help you or help anyone.

146
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:55,049
So, after realisation, as you are very well protected,

147
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:58,013
you have all the blessings and a great future,

148
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:11,059
you also have a great possibility of a  complete annihilation.

149
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:18,361
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing, and everybody is supporting you to climb,

150
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:24,848
holding your hand, and there are so many things by which you are protected,

151
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:30,554
to be taken upward, there’s no possibility of falling off by mistake also,

152
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:36,968
but if you try to remove your bondages with Truth and Love and

153
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:41,074
all the time try to hit the people who are trying to support you,

154
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:44,733
then you fall from a great height, greater height.

155
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:51,646
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater you fall, and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

156
00:17:51,646 --> 00:18:01,881
But every effort is made by the Divine, every support is given to you, every care is taken – despite that,

157
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:06,538
if you want to fall, then from that height, is very dangerous.

158
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:12,640
But Ekadasha Rudra, at that time, at such a time when somebody tries to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga,

159
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:21,633
after being in Sahaja Yoga, then hits you so badly that the whole attack is very widespread.

160
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:30,604
But the whole family can be protected if there are few people of that family doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

161
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:39,726
But in case the family that is against all the time of sahaja yogis and try to trouble them,

162
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:42,624
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad way.

163
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:48,132
Now these Ekadasha Rudras come out of, as I told you, from the Void.

164
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:54,429
So, we can say that the destruction part of it comes from the Void mainly.

165
00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:03,476
But these are the powers, all are given in one person that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus Christ.

166
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,132
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

167
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:11,804
He’s the personification of Omkara, he’s the Personification of vibrations.

168
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:20,356
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe starts breaking.

169
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:26,840
As He personifies the power of the Mother which is penetrating into every atom,

170
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,960
into every molecule, and to every human being, into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

171
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,194
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets into a jeopardy.

172
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:44,054
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

173
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:48,538
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like small children”

174
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:53,881
That is, the innocence, the purity of the heart is the best way you can please Him.

175
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:59,179
As in the West, specially, people have developed their brains too much,

176
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:08,558
they try to play about with words and think that nobody knows what they are doing.

177
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:15,828
All such people must know that everything you do is known to God.

178
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:30,991
If you are not clean in the heart, it is very dangerous for anybody to pose as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

179
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:37,912
Such people are not possessed, nor they are conditioned, nor they are egoistical,

180
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:46,069
but they are very cunning clever people and they are quite aware, as to what they are doing.

181
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:50,969
But, there are people who get possessed also and then they, in that ,

182
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:56,815
they try to destroy themselves or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

183
00:20:56,815 --> 00:21:00,412
There are some who think that if they hurt themselves

184
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:06,328
or do some sort of an extreme thing then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

185
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:10,068
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga, then you should know that something is wrong with you.

186
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:15,085
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga then you must know that there’s something definitely wrong with you.

187
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:20,463
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja yogis, then be sure something is wrong with you.

188
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:28,960
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness of God, then there’s something wrong with you.

189
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,913
If you are still worried about negative people and their problems then know that there’s something wrong with you.

190
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:45,443
If you have sympathies with negative people, then also there’s something wrong with you.

191
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:57,492
But if you have anger for negative and all that is negative that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are there.

192
00:21:57,492 --> 00:22:04,085
When this thing gets matured then you become the power of Ekadasha Rudra yourself.

193
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:11,554
Anybody who will try to insult you or to do any harm, will collapse.

194
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:17,449
It has happened with many people who tried to be insulting to me or tried to harm me or anyway….

195
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:27,177
sometimes I am quite worried about them.

196
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:36,102
So one has to be in such a way that they become the Ekadasha.

197
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:41,522
Nobody can touch such people.

198
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:47,379
But such a person is full of compassion and forgiveness.

199
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:53,163
As a result, Ekadasha acts much faster.

200
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:58,393
The more compassionate you are the more powerful Ekadasha becomes.

201
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:04,603
The more collective you become, the more Ekadasha acts.

202
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:11,343
Many people have a habit of receding back into their exclusion and saying

203
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:18,312
“Oh we better be at home and it’s alright,” but they don’t know what they are missing.

204
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:24,875
Whatever may be your experience with others, you should stick-on together, always attend programmes,

205
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:34,539
take leadership, go ahead with it, work it out and you will be blessed thousand- fold.

206
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:42,959
Ekadasha Rudra are all the powers, I would say, of destruction, together.

207
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:46,194
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

208
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:52,256
It is the destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

209
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:58,744
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

210
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:20,304
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana, Kartikeya and Ganesha.

211
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:29,194
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

212
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:37,148
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations are Ekadashas.

213
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:45,953
Now the last but not the least, is the destructive power of Hiranyagarbha which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

214
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:57,609
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes, the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive power.

215
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:04,479
So, thus, the complete total destructive power is Ekadasha Rudra.

216
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:10,905
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but it’s not blind.

217
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:17,350
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately woven.

218
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:25,477
It avoids all the good points and attacks the wrong things and it hits at the right time,

219
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:35,318
at the right point, direct, without hitting anything that is good in between.

220
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:40,872
Now the glance of Ekadasha Rudra falls upon someone, say, for example,

221
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:50,759
and there is something in between which is divine or which is a positive thing [then] it penetrates through positive,

222
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,264
without harming the positive and hits the negative.

223
00:25:55,264 --> 00:26:04,446
It cools down somebody and burns another.

224
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,424
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools down. (Laughter.)

225
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:08,227
So that is how it works with such care and such delicacy.

226
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:11,598
And it is tremendously sharp also.

227
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,565
And it’s very painful.

228
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:18,447
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot, it goes on slowly, slowly.

229
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:28,633
All the horrible tortures that you have learnt or heard about are expressions of Ekadasha only.

230
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:32,581
For example, take the case of cancer.

231
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:38,832
In the cancer thing, you see, the nose is removed, the tongues are removed,

232
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:48,800
then the gullet is removed, then everything goes on, one after [another], being removed with terrible pain, you see.

233
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,517
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot feel their fingers,

234
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:58,285
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything eats their fingers they can’t feel it,

235
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:08,331
so they start losing their fingers, that is how Ekadasha eats up people, devours.

236
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:23,552
But this wrathfulness of the Father can be very gentle and could be very sweet, when it comes to His own children.

237
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:31,392
The story is about the Mother – once She got very angry, the Primordial Mother.

238
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:36,200
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy the whole world with Her Ekadasha power and

239
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,987
She tried to destroy the whole world.

240
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:46,815
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself felt that She is being [a] bit too much angry.

241
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:55,321
So when She started destroying, and She was going right and left,

242
00:27:55,321 --> 00:28:03,830
He did not know what to do, so He took Her child, that means representing sahaja yogi, you can say,

243
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:14,064
representing Christ or representing anyone of these great children of Her’s, that he put the child under Her feet.

244
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:20,822
So, when She was stamping, suddenly She saw Her own child under Her feet and Her such a big tongue came out.

245
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:31,392
She just stopped. Balancing. But this has happened only once. (laughter)

246
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:42,596
So, after the Ekadasha Rudra, ultimately the complete destruction comes through the anger of Sadashiva.

247
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:48,442
When the final total destruction takes place.

248
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:59,850
So thus we have seen how Ekadasha Rudra acts and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves Ekadasha Rudra.

249
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:20,143
Now to develop this power one has to develop a tremendous power of detachment,

250
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:23,476
power of detachment, detachment from negative.

251
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:27,723
For example, negativity can come from very near people,

252
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:33,756
like brother, mother, sister, could come from friends, could come from relatives.

253
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:41,603
It could come from a country, it could come from your political ideas, economic ideas, anything like that.

254
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:49,174
Any misidentification can destroy your power of Ekadasha Rudra.

255
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:53,957
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I am surrendered to Sahaja Yoga and I am a sahaja yogi,”

256
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:59,174
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:04,127
So that, intelligently, you understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

258
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:07,425
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent

259
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:21,593
and if the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter into their intelligence you can never overcome your attachments.

260
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:26,660
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about Sahaja Yoga or you give lectures on that,

261
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,379
but mentally you should also understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

262
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:39,065
Today is a special day when it has been asked that we should have Ekadasha Rudra puja,

263
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:52,316
and is for all kinds of false religious sects and false gurus and false religions,

264
00:30:52,316 --> 00:31:02,773
which are followed in the name of God, or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

265
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:11,892
and does not achieve Self-realisation and does not get connected with God, is false.

266
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:23,013
So any such thing that is just faith and talks of God but has no connection with God cannot be a true religion.

267
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:29,407
Of course, it gives a balance to people, but in giving that balance,

268
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:43,103
if people live on that money and try to enjoy a wealth out of that money,

269
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:50,190
then it is not even at the very lower level is the religion.

270
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,290
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to give you a balance to begin with, but in that balancing when they tell,

271
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:04,005
“You have to be balanced, but give me money for that, you must give me money, give me all your purse, give me everything,”

272
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:13,892
then that cannot be balanced, it does not even have a slightest thing of the blessings of God.

273
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:20,383
Or any religion that makes you bow to anybody else but the incarnation, is no religion.

274
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:23,549
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

275
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:30,048
The real religion will give you a balance and will always talk about the ascent.

276
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:36,956
But they will not ask for money or make one man something great as venerated.

277
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:47,954
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between falsehood, negative things and real things.

278
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:51,858
Once you develop that discrimination through vibratory awareness,

279
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:59,049
or through your intelligence, you are in the control of yourself.

280
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:07,549
And then you become that power of Ekadasha, when you establish your maturity.

281
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:17,455
Today, I bless you all, that you all become the power of Ekadasha Rudra

282
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:28,606
and you develop that sincerity which takes you to that state.

283
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,627
May God Bless you.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May God Bless you.
