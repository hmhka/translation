00003  Significance of Puja – Paris, 20.04.1980
00007  I have told you before also but again today I want to tell you the significance of Puja.
00011  The significance is this, that when you do the Puja you recognize Me.
00015  By your recognition and your surrendering the deities get happy.
00019  They’re overjoyed that you have recognized it.
00023  You are fully identified yourself that you are understanding Me in My full form,
00027  that you are coming closer to them.
00031  And I tell the like elder brothers feel happy when the younger ones are coming to meet.
00035  So, they start releasing My vibrations with a greater force – much greater force.
00039  You have seen that after Puja sometimes when you do not absorb the vibrations,
00043  I get little tired because the vibrations start coming out of all the chakras and you do not absorb,
00047  so the give and take process is not balanced.
00051  The identification in the west is very slow because of mental activity.
00055  Your attachment to your mental activity and to your rationality is very great.
00059  With puja the vibrations try to detach you from your mental activity,
00063  from your rationality and then you are stationed into the realm of divine existence.
00067  Anything else, even My lecture, which is really mantra – but even that gives you a mental activity.
00071  You start thinking about it.
00075  Then by thinking about it, you think, you know about Sahaja Yoga.
00079  Then by thinking that you know, you become egoistical.
00083  You think you know such a lot about Sahaja Yoga.
00087  That again it, in a way, helps to bloat your ego.
00091  That you start thinking that you know so much about Sahaja Yoga.
00095  The greatest grip on the western being is that of rationality – analyzing.
00099  You start analyzing everything.
00103  Which is only through puja you just you are blown off, like when the fruit is ready,
00107  the petals of the flower out of which the fruit has come out, blow off and the fruit remains.
00111  This complete detachment is possible in even one puja.
00115  But that too takes time, because even puja is rationalized.
00119  Puja should be done with your heart, feeling the love within you, that you are worshipping your mother,
00123  who is an incarnation of Adi Shakti, is a very great thing.
00127  Do it with your heart, not with your mind.
00131  That’s why you know we do not allow many people to come for puja,
00135  because that creates another whirlwind of rationality.
00139  Once you are detached from yourself, all your problems become so tiny as you see from the sky,
00143  from the aeroplane all the farfetched things which are not so important.
00147  And the problems that are going in the houses down below do not touch you.
00151  You go beyond clouds and you live in the area of that space of divine love.
00155  Then all your petty things irritating things, all your so called problems of live,
00159  all disappear and then only you can be effective more, much more effective,
00163  because you become a source of divine love.
00167  Puja is the only way I feel you can stop your mental activity.
00171  Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood trough rationality.
00175  Mentally it may be, but to become you have to detach yourself completely.
00179  You have to go beyond it, because this limits your movement.
00183  Everything that you are doing here is significant,
00187  but it’s not a mental significance, it has a divine significance.
00191  For example even painting My feet now. What you do is to recognize Me first of all.
00195  Then the bottoms importance of this feet: this feet have been working,
00199  have been dancing for thousands and thousands and thousands of years
00203  (break-in: Shri Mataji asks: Where is she gone…).
00207  Like we use lemons.
00211  Rationally we cannot explain how lemons can cure a person, but they do, you have seen.
00215  People being cured of mental troubles, of possessions.
00219  You cannot explain rationally.
00223  In the divine way one can explain,
00227  that it has got a coefficient which can absorb the possessions which are foreign.
00231  But why and how?
00235  That’s beyond your mind.
00239  You do not understand, you do not have that instrument.
00243  So it comes, that Sahaja Yoga is to be accepted. It’s the only way you can be a Sahaja Yogi.
00247  Acceptance is the only way.
00251  Go on accepting it, so that you can develop.
00255  Like a little plant starts accepting whatever the Mother Earth gives it and grows.
00259  It does not try to understand the Mother Earth. It does not.
00263  It just wants to grow on the riches of the Mother Earth.
00267  That is what is puja by which you are blessed by the divine so that you shoot off (08:13)
00271  should of from all your physical, mental, emotional and the so called spiritual being,
00275  which was seeking into the realm where you have sought.
00279  So today we must determine that we’ll have no rational activity about it,
00283  otherwise you want won’t have the joy of Sahaja Yoga, which is your achievement.
00287  Stop rationalizing it. With your heart you do the puja.
00291  All these things that you are going to do has very, very great significance,
00295  which I’ll explain to you some other time, but that explanation cannot take you too far.
00299  It is too minute to enter into the gross understanding.
00303  So best is to absorb it and absorb it and enjoy it.
00307  Why do you want to enter into the whole machinery of electricity?
00311  You just use the electricity.
00315  All machinery is done for you, is prepared for you.
00319  Don’t try to envisage it, to conceive it in your little mind.
00323  You must know that you have to become the ocean
00327  and not try to understand the ocean with the drop of your brain.
00331  If you realize that, then you can become the ocean.
00335  Your limits are broken by puja and you become one with the unlimited.
00339  It blasts you limits and your limitations.
00343  Tell your mind not to come and trouble you during puja, then it will work out.
00347  May God bless you! (Shri Mataji gives order to somebody).
00351  But you’re small children, so it does no matter.
00355  It’s a pleasant task.
00359  Little understanding must be developed,
00363  that there is a protocol of this Incarnation and you should not try to pass over it.
00367  The greatest protocol is humility, is humbleness.
00371  Humility is the only way you are given this great opportunity to worship Me.
00375  If you are not humble, you cannot worship Me.
00379  It’s not a ritual, it’s the growing within our self. in yourself.
00383  Stop your mental activity now, just don’t think, then only it will start working. May God bless you! (11:59)
00387  This name stresses the excellence of Dakshinachara by implication, all right.
00391  It’s all right for them.
00395  The names 99 to 108 describe the Kundalini
00399  Yoga briefly.
00403  The individual soul which has used a form of ‘Jīva’ loses its sense of identity with the cosmic soul and identifies itself with the body and mind.
00407  The Kundalini Yoga helps the individual soul to regain its identity with the divine mother,
00411  which is the cosmic consciousness.
00415  Individual consciousness in its lower state is the wakeful state.
00419  The Jīva’s name in this state is ‘Vishwa’.
00423  In this, the individual is mostly body conscious.
00427  It is normally difficult for the individual to transcend this state consciously.
00431  The next one is the state of consciousness of the individual in a dream – ‘Sushupti’.
00435  Here the impressions are all mental.
00439  The body consciousness is mostly replaced by mental configuration
00443  or ordinarily an individual cannot get into this state
00447  or transcend to higher levels of consciousness through one’s will.
00451  The Jīva is here called ‘Tejasa’. Tejasa is the light.
00455  The next higher state of consciousness is one in dreamlessly.
00459  Here Jīva is beyond both, the body and mind and is called as ‘Prāgñā’, is enlightened.
00463  Here the body and mind are both inactive.
00467  The Jīva be freed of body and mental activity has reached a higher level of consciousness.
00471  But here, though this consciousness is nearer the cosmic, it is still limited.
00475  It is only when he transcends this Prāgñā state
00479  and becomes ‘Turīya’ – Turīya means the fourth – that he regains his identity with cosmic consciousness.
00483  In Kundalini Yoga the devotee trough the grace of guru
00487  and Shri Lalita as Iccha-Shakti – as the desire power of the guru.
00491  But actually here Shri Lalita is sitting before you.
00495  So it’s such a great thing for you. Sters (? – 14:49) dormant Kundalini coiled up as body consciousness in Mooladhara
00499  and by conscious effort of will makes her pierce through the six chakras from Mooladhara to Agnya.
00503  Once the Kundalini rises and goes beyond Agnya the devotee becomes cosmic conscious or Turīya.
00507  The transition from one state to the next higher state seems to be similar to opening a difficult gate
00511  or undergoing a tied up knot – Granthi.
00515  The body consciousness of Vishwa seems to extend up to Swadishthana
00519  and there is placed the Brahma-Granthi or –knot. Brahma-Granthi there.
00523  From this the next state of consciousness of Jīva called Tejasa extends above Anahata,
00527  where the Vishnu-Granthi is placed – see Brahma- Granthi and then Vishnu-Granthi is placed.
00531  Granthi means when two things bind together.
00535  So it is between Vishuddhi and Heart this Granthi takes place – Vishnu-Granthi.
00539  This state of consciousness of Jīva called Prāgñā similar to dreamlessly extends up to Agnya,
00543  above which is Rudra-Granthi.
00547  Between this is Turīya state, where individual and cosmic consciousness unite.
00551  Now see, all this three you cross and then the last Granthi you cross also.
00555  The Kundalini rises just like a jet as you know in this, because of Me.
00559  But the gurus have to do it one by one.
00563  The have to open every Granthi ,
00567  they have to work it out and put it up there and keep it down, then again and this this.
00571  Shri Mataji scold with Yogis, because they catch on the heart now (…).
00575  From this the next state of consciousness of Jīva, called –
00579  I hope you have not recorded My scolding –
00583  where the Vishnu-Granthi is placed.
00587  Give yourself a Bandhan.
00591  Give her a Bandhan.
00595  Every time she goes, she catches.
00599  So, beyond this is Turīya state, where individual and cosmic consciousness unite.
00603  (21:05) Now all this from 99 to 108 is Kundalini Yoga (Anm.: Lalita Sahasranama).
00607  You should remember this names by heart, it’s good idea.
00611  It’s not much from 99 to 108 how many they make? 9 names.
00615  So, not difficult for you to know.
00619  They have given the chakras on this, you see. Now, nobody knows Hindi.
00623  She can read it.
00627  Shri Mataji give something to the Yogis: Give it to Linda.
00631  You all put it to, is good for all of you.
00635  Better put it, Just put it in your eyes and also smell a little bit of that, the badhas will run away.
00639  Shri Mataji laughs.
00643  Now, smell it, come along!
00647  See, if you have ladies as your disciples, at the slightest they start crying, is the big problem.
00651  Shri Mataji laughs again…. (…)
00655  Now, read it!
