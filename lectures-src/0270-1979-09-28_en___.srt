1
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:07,015
Today I am going to address you in English language,

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,817
as desired by you.

3
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:14,280
Even tomorrow perhaps we may have to use this foreign language.

4
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:24,560
Today's subject is the relationship between Kundalini and Kalki.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,500
The word Kalki, actually is an abbreviation of the word Nishkalank.

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,039
Nishkalank means the same as my name is, which means Nirmala:

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,907
that there it is a spotlessly clean,

8
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:44,556
something that is spotlessly clean is Nishkalanka,

9
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,915
without any spots on.

10
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:54,014
Now this incarnation has been described in many Puranas

11
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:56,331
- will be coming on this earth

12
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,331
on a white horse,

13
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:03,842
in a village of Sambhaalpur, they call it, Sambhaalpur.

14
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:09,315
Is very interesting how people take everything so literally.

15
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,066
The world ‘Sambhaala’ means:

16
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:17,306
‘bhaala’ is this forehead, ‘sambhaal’ means ‘at that stage’.

17
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:25,149
That means Kalki is situated on your "bhaala".

18
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:27,485
Bhaal is the forehead.

19
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,164
And here He’s going to be born,

20
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:38,535
that is the real meaning of the word Sambhaalpur.

21
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:48,173
In between, Jesus Christ and His destroying

22
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:52,765
incarnation of Mahavishnu

23
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,556
- called as Kalki,

24
00:01:56,803 --> 00:02:05,282
there is a time given to human beings to rectify themselves,

25
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,602
for them to enter into the Kingdom of God,

26
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:13,554
which in the Bible is called as Last Judgment.

27
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:19,325
That you'll be judged, all of you, will be judged on this earth.

28
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:23,529
The population of the world is the maximum, they say,

29
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,815
because all those - practically

30
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:28,089
all those who had

31
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:33,678
aspirations to enter into the Kingdom of God are born

32
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:38,742
in the modern times and are going to be born very soon.

33
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,486
This is the most important time,

34
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,453
because Sahaja Yoga is the Last Judgment.

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,381
It is fantastic to hear this, but that's a fact and it's the Truth.

36
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,868
Though you can understand that Mother's love

37
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:00,642
makes it very easy for you to get to

38
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:05,524
your realization, and that the whole story of Last Judgment,

39
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:09,739
which looks such a horrifying experience,

40
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,768
has been made very beautiful

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,393
and very tender and delicate and doesn't disturb you.

42
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,547
But this is the Last Judgment I tell you,

43
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:22,719
and you all are going to be judged, through

44
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:27,742
Sahaja Yoga, whether you can enter into the Kingdom of God or not.

45
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,469
Now in Sahaja Yoga people come in

46
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:34,995
with different kind of attentions or chitta.

47
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:40,594
There could be people who have too much of ‘tamasi krutya’,

48
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:45,589
or what we call the inertia

49
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:52,682
or the more sort of sluggish or slow moving temperaments.

50
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:58,530
These, when they are exaggerated, people take to

51
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:02,817
spirits or take to alcohols

52
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,686
or to some such things which take you away from Reality

53
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,226
and make you numb within.

54
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:16,200
The other side is, as you know right-hand side

55
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,884
 people, who have got too much ambitions.

56
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,482
They're extremely ambitious people,

57
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,946
they want to win the whole world and they want to become

58
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,548
something independent on their own, malignant and cancerous.

59
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,854
They do not want to keep their relationship with the whole.

60
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,083
You can see in this Kaliyuga,

61
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:37,623
how people have gone to their extremes.

62
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,788
Some of them are very much indulging

63
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,994
 into too much of alcoholism or you can call it

64
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,205
something - running away from your awareness,

65
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:47,907
from your Self, from Truth, the Beauty.

66
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,972
The others are, denying it, they are denying everything

67
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:56,613
that is beautiful and are ego-oriented.

68
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,650
So we have people who are superego oriented,

69
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:03,040
very much conditioned and lethargic and lazy

70
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,091
and absolutely primitive.

71
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:08,286
The other side is that we have people

72
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:11,390
who are extremely ambitious - dominating,

73
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:16,425
and are destroying each other by their ambition and competition.

74
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,522
These two types of people of extreme nature,

75
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:24,855
are rather difficult to enter into Sahaja

76
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:29,365
Yoga, but, the people who are in the center

77
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,609
are easily absorbed in the Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,751
Moreover people who are less complicated,

79
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,913
simple hearted as they are in the villages,

80
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:43,181
are very easily absorbed by Sahaja Yoga,

81
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:45,955
and they take to it without any difficulty.

82
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:48,687
Say in the city you can see the result of

83
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:52,116
so much of work of mine that there are hardly about

84
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,098
2 to 300 people today over here.

85
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,247
But, if I go to a village, the whole village, say up to

86
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,651
5 to 6,000 people come round and

87
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:04,234
all of them get their realization without any difficulty.

88
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:07,274
Because here people are supposed to be very busy,

89
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:10,494
they have so many other preoccupations.

90
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,195
They think other things are much more important

91
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:16,347
than seeking God and wasting your time in

92
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,243
such pursuits like seeking God.

93
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,409
Under such circumstances,

94
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,928
Sahaja Yoga takes its roots,

95
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:29,358
very sweetly into the heart of all the seekers.

96
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:34,546
It works very spontaneously.

97
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:38,113
You get your realization without any difficulty,

98
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,333
without any effort, without paying for it,

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,380
without going into any sort of strenuous exercises.

100
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:50,886
But, when we talk of Kalki we have to remember,

101
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:54,051
that between getting our realization

102
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:58,859
and entering into the Kingdom of God, we can falter very much.

103
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:03,542
This is called as ‘Yoga bhrashta sthiti’.

104
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:07,270
People take to yoga, they come into yoga,

105
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:11,556
and are then enchanted still by their pravrutis
(tendencies).

106
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:15,455
For example an ego oriented man or a money oriented man

107
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,734
or a man who wants to dominate,

108
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:21,830
can form a group of people whom he would dominate

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,670
by his ideas and

110
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:27,034
can go in for a fall and the rest of them will also go down.

111
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,463
In Sahaja Yoga itself.

112
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,741
This has been happening in Bombay, very, very

113
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:34,086
often, it's a very very common thing that has been going on.

114
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,055
But this is called as ‘Yogabhrashtata’,

115
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,526
where a person falls from his yoga,

116
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:41,526
he comes down on his yoga,

117
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,929
because Sahaja Yoga gives you all the freedom,

118
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:46,070
whether to fall or to come up.

119
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,349
But if you go to any other guru,

120
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:52,135
doing any other sort of yoga in which purification takes place,

121
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:55,942
and where people are trained and disciplined from very childhood,

122
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,130
 in those yogas a guru

123
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,874
will somehow or other see that you are injured

124
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:03,212
or you are hurt so badly that you have no

125
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,205
connections with anybody else,

126
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:08,913
 like an operation. They take out that personality and throw him out.

127
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:11,621
But here it is left to your freedom

128
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:15,804
to understand that, you have to keep to the mains,

129
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,048
you have to keep to the group,

130
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:24,434
you have to keep to the whole, and not to one person here and there

131
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:28,298
who is trying to overpower the rest of you.

132
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,947
In Sahaja Yoga anybody who tries to come up too much

133
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:34,533
comes down, because in nature you have seen,

134
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:37,152
nothing grows out of bounds.

135
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:40,353
Like human beings are of a certain height,

136
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,120
the trees are of certain heights,

137
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,456
everything is controlled.

138
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,585
You cannot try to show off in Sahaja Yoga,

139
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:51,183
neither you should try to make a different

140
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,436
group or a different type of some special thing.

141
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,204
Specially I have seen in Sahaja Yoga there are people

142
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,986
who come up and ask people to touch their feet.

143
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,559
It is most surprising that

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,706
invariably  such people get exposed in no time

145
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,714
and one knows that they are gone cases.

146
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,459
Because their chakras are caught

147
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,452
they're badly caught, though they may not feel for a while.

148
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,368
Their vibrations may be there, but

149
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:18,053
they go down and down and down, till they are completely finished.

150
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,769
Now this ‘yoga bhrashta sthiti’ is the

151
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,037
worst thing that can happen to anyone.

152
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,055
First of all you don't get your yoga.

153
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:28,760
And if you get your yoga and then jump to this sort of a condition,

154
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,040
about which Shri Krishna has described

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,694
that you go into rakshasa yoni.

156
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,630
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga

157
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:40,244
must know that you have to stick on to one thing, properly,

158
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:42,742
otherwise what is the yoni left,

159
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,667
if you die without yoga maybe you are born again, maybe

160
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:47,889
- of course your... This life is wasted!

161
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:50,860
But if you try such tricks after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

162
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,728
and try to impress on others

163
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,920
that you are a very great realized

164
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,244
soul or that you have achieved this and achieved that

165
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,337
- all this nonsense that you
have been doing before getting to realization

166
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:05,118
- then, there is a very serious

167
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:08,440
offence and you are punished for that.

168
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,940
This is the power of Kalki, which is secretly working

169
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,794
behind Sahaja Yoga.

170
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,302
For example there was a lady who

171
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:18,536
came to see Me, wanted to publish something

172
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:21,413
about Me and she was paid by some horrible fellow.

173
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:25,165
And she published something nonsensical something that I never do.

174
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:27,689
So everybody was very annoyed and angry and said:

175
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:30,503
"Mother You must punish her and we must take her to courts,

176
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,318
 you must do defamation, this that.

177
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,544
I said "I'm not going to go to court,

178
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:36,596
you better go give up these ideas."

179
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,500
But nobody would listen, you see.

180
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,646
It so happened that that paper closed down for

181
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,015
three and a half months; and they had

182
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,360
such a big setback.

183
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:48,266
Of course this is not done by Me I would say
as far as Mataji Nirmala Devi is concerned,

184
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:49,490
but is done by Kalki.

185
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:53,193
Kalki, means there are eleven powers,

186
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:56,674
which are, guarding, the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,959
Anybody who tries to play around

188
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,195
with Sahaja Yoga is harmed very badly.

189
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:05,394
So today is a day of telling you about,

190
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:11,120
the dangers of playing with the Divine.

191
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,657
So far, people have been taking them for granted.

192
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:16,712
They have tortured people like Christ,

193
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,989
they have tortured great saints, all the time human

194
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,584
beings have been torturing

195
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:24,935
and I've been warning in every lecture practically, that - don't

196
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,303
try that trick today, because Kalki is already on!

197
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:31,649
And don't try to trouble anybody

198
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,178
who is a saintly person who is a good person!

199
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:37,715
Be careful about it, because Kalki is on!

200
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:40,695
And once this power comes on you,

201
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,223
you would not know how to hide yourself!

202
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:45,518
Not only those who are Sahaja Yogis,

203
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:49,781
but this I am telling to the whole world today, that - Be careful!

204
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,880
Do not try to harm others.

205
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,424
Do not try to take advantage of others

206
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,867
and do not try to show off your own power!

207
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:04,713
Because once this destruction will start in your life,

208
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:07,343
you won't know how to stop it!

209
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,256
Once I went to,

210
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,977
I think I have told you before also this thing that I went to

211
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,057
Andhra Pradesh,

212
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,730
and there I told people, that "You should not

213
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:21,003
grow anymore of this tambaku - tobacco."

214
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,202
And they were very angry with Me,

215
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,048
because they thought this was their living.

216
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,691
They were minting money and indulging in all kinds of things

217
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,807
making too much money and doing all kinds of ‘paapas’ (sins).

218
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,736
I said "In this world today you have come not,

219
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,195
for creating more paap and more karmas

220
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,962
on your head, but to do

221
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:42,521
the cleansing of the paapas, the ‘papaksh talana’.

222
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,808
You have not come here to add to your sins, but to cleanse them.

223
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,646
This is the time of cleansing,

224
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:52,195
that's why I am here as Nirmala, to cleanse it, while,

225
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,026
what are you doing is to add to your paapas,

226
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,185
what are you going to gain out of growing

227
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:59,731
this horrible tobacco?"

228
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:01,665
But they would not listen to me;

229
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:04,851
and then, in three of my lectures - it is on the tape,

230
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,423
people are saying - that I said that, "Be careful!

231
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:15,854
The Kalki in the sea will take the spite on you.

232
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,405
It will come on you!"

233
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,579
And you know what happened in Andhra.

234
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:22,885
Same with Morvi, I will tell you.

235
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,876
Only last year some people met Me from Morvi,

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,792
some very big people from Morvi.

237
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,343
And they all believed in a horrible ‘saint’,

238
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,951
who was a horrible fellow, and who has really

239
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,592
destroyed families after families.

240
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,803
I told them: "Why do you believe in this man,

241
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,136
he is taking your attention to materialistic things?

242
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,621
Why do you believe in him?"

243
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:45,033
Every house in Morvi had the picture of this horrible saint.

244
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,699
And when I told them they would not listen to me,

245
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:50,004
they thought that, I was just warning

246
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,871
them because I was sort of jealous of that fellow,

247
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,079
and you know what has happened about Morvi.

248
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,258
Is a fact!

249
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:01,678
All these things have been said in the presence of other people,

250
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,775
so that they have noted it

251
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,894
down, that what has happened, in what place

252
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:08,585
and how Mataji has said.

253
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,817
Before that, also in Delhi once, I met some of these people from Vrindavan,

254
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,335
and who were telling Me,

255
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,378
"All of you give up your about the pandas and this and that, and I said:

256
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,042
professions horrible people you are!

257
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,781
What business have you got to make money in the name of God?”

258
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,605
And all those pandits and pandas and all these

259
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,693
people are horrible parasites on the society.

260
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:31,990
You get out of your jobs or this...

261
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,310
the river Ganges on which you have been feeding

262
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,234
yourself will one day, ruin you completely."

263
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:40,992
And when the floods in the river Yamuna

264
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:43,590
and the Ganges came in I was in London, I saw

265
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,929
on the TV all these pandas running away 
with all their Khomchas and everything.

266
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:51,682
Of course, with these horrible people when you associate,

267
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:54,779
when you live with them, you also suffer.

268
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:56,602
The innocent suffer.

269
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,507
Why should you be impressed by such people?

270
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,360
That's the thing you have to pay for!

271
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:04,161
When you are impressed you are so compromising.

272
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,553
“After all doesn't matter we are going there,

273
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,059
so we must give something to this fellow also,

274
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:13,342
he is a panda, of our forefathers - sitting
down there and begging money,

275
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,598
sitting before the river Ganges."

276
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:17,986
Imagine: the Giver of

277
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:21,478
Love and the Giver of Joy is flowing there and these people are

278
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,733
sitting with their backs towards the river

279
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,661
and asking money from you.

280
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:29,778
What silly people they are, such stupid, useless people!

281
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,351
And you pay them money, and you think

282
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:37,181
that you have done a great punya by donating money to them!

283
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,382
This sort of life we have been leading,

284
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:45,579
a compromising, not understanding, what is Truth,

285
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:46,691
what is not Truth.

286
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:50,053
One side is a complete blind faith

287
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,116
into all this kind of thing that is going on in this country and all over the world

288
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,182
 but specially too much in this country.

289
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:59,749
We are simple innocent people, with lot of

290
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,655
‘bhavikta’ within us.

291
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,822
That's true, but that doesn't mean we should be stupid and fools.

292
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:11,483
For example, the other day at a meeting

293
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:15,893
in a place called Awargaon, I said that,

294
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:23,323
these people, in the Vithala's mandir, called as bhadaweii,

295
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,009
should be nicely punished for the

296
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,392
way they are ill-treating these

297
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:31,584
saints, going down there on their feet for days together

298
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,447
and something must be done to them.

299
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:40,564
And everybody was a little annoyed when I said, because for these poor people, these

300
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:45,227
bhadawas, who are rakshasas incarnate, are something great.

301
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,425
They break the heads of the people,

302
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,357
who walk all the thousand of miles there, they break

303
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,101
their heads just like coconuts and all of them have

304
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,325
pain in the head.

305
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,336
Such cruelty they confer on these

306
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,646
 innocent simple people, and do you think I should support

307
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:07,395
them when I stand for Truth and for Religion and for Compassion?

308
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,588
When I said this some people, you see,

309
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:13,079
who had some vested interest, must be the relations

310
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,733
of the bhadawas or whatever it is, got angry with Me.

311
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,684
But thank God, within three months time,

312
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:21,029
the whole thing has been taken over, by Government.

313
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:24,911
It is so common with us

314
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:28,540
that we see with our open eyes what is happening.

315
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:31,260
Still we will be going on doing the same

316
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:34,049
thing in the temples, even in the name of God,

317
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,068
we are doing sins after sins!

318
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:40,438
We are adding sins to our sins and, instead

319
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:44,450
of clearing it out and understanding it through

320
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,720
our developed brain, we just go on adding it.

321
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,363
This is what I call the people who are tamasi,

322
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:54,698
who do not use your brains, they are mulabuddhis.

323
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,503
They just follow somebody because

324
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,246
there's some sort of a hypnotic influence or some

325
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,594
sort of a charismatic

326
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:06,018
movement that is on in the West, you can see, these charismatic

327
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,229
people will take thousands of rupees from them!

328
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:09,646
Thousands of rupees!

329
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:12,949
And they will give them epilepsy, gangrene,

330
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:16,815
if not that, madness, lunacy all sorts of things.

331
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:22,425
But people like-mad are running after all these movements

332
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:24,500
and are adding up to their

333
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:29,035
destruction, to their, pile of sins that they have committed,

334
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:33,035
instead of spending some time in cleansing their sins.

335
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:40,459
This time, what we have got, is a most precious time

336
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,257
and one has to be very careful and alert about oneself.

337
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,448
One should not depend on any other person for help in this.

338
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,418
But should try to completely consolidate,

339
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,533
one's own being into the Kingdom of God,

340
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:59,232
and occupy the highest seat in the Heart of God Almighty.

341
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:03,386
Because when Kalki will come, He will slaughter all these

342
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,706
people without any compassion!

343
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:07,808
He is devoid of any compassion!

344
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:09,846
There are eleven Rudras in Him,

345
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:13,529
means there are eleven destructive powers absolutely powerfully

346
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:16,227
settled in Him and when I see all that,

347
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:19,116
because I can see all that, this emergency grows into

348
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,505
Me and I tell you: beware of it!

349
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:24,694
Don't play fool with it!

350
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:32,357
Don't take it easy and do not compromise with nonsensical people! Stick on to the right!

351
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:37,027
Otherwise, the day is very near when Kalki is going to come!

352
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:44,288
The other type of people are - who think no end of their intelligence.

353
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,967
They have denied God.

354
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,937
They say "Where is God? There is no God.

355
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,256
We don't believe in God.

356
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,572
It's all nonsense, science is everything".

357
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:55,641
What has science done so far? Let's see that!

358
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,181
What has science done for us?

359
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,879
Science has done nothing so far,

360
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,612
 it has only done all dead work!

361
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,022
It has only made you ego-oriented.

362
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,448
All the West is ego-oriented,

363
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:12,879
they are finding all the methods of committing sins.

364
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:15,093
How to commit the worst sins

365
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:18,524
-they are finding methods, and there are certain gurus in India,

366
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:20,212
who are also supplying the knowledge:

367
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,729
how to commit even worse and worse and worse sins.

368
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,754
So, they can easily go with two running jumps to hell.

369
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,184
Whatever is wrong is wrong, whether it istoday,

370
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,996
tomorrow or yesterday or thousands

371
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,237
of years back, whatever is wrong for your dharma,

372
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,049
for your sustenance, is wrong!

373
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,919
The new phrase, is that "What's wrong in this,

374
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,130
what's wrong in that?"

375
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:50,495
That question will be answered by Kalki only!

376
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,426
I'm just telling you that it is wrong,

377
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,631
and it is extremely wrong, it is against your ascent,

378
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,849
it is against your being,

379
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,347
and then you will not have any time to repent and to

380
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,048
ask this question, "What's wrong?", you will be chopped off.

381
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:10,062
That is what, is the Kalki incarnation.

382
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:13,072
He is going to come on a white horse, as they say.

383
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:19,058
It's a tremendous thing that is going to work out!

384
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:24,327
Every human being is going to be sorted out,

385
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:28,204
and nobody can then claim!
See?

386
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:30,608
Everything is being advertised.

387
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:35,352
Everything is being published even this instrument [tapping the microphone] that is created by

388
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:38,844
science, we can use for spreading Sahaja Yoga you know,

389
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:41,168
that if I put it on my chakras

390
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,709
you get the vibrations and you get your realization.

391
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:47,995
The whole science is subservient to Sahaja Yoga.

392
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,428
Like, the other day some TV people came, they

393
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:52,504
said "Mother we want to have your TV done."

394
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,639
I said "You be careful. Before doing it.

395
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,063
I don't want any publicity, but whatever you do it, do it properly."

396
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:03,246
Through TV we can give Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:05,554
Supposing I am there, on the TV screen,

398
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,911
I can ask people to put their hands and there

399
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:10,215
can be thousands who can get realization,

400
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,762
only seeing on the TV.

401
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:15,623
Is a fact, that this is emitting from My being, is a fact!

402
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:18,179
Why should you feel angry about it?

403
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:20,238
Why don't you come and test it?

404
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:22,149
Why should you be hurt,

405
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,903
why your ego should hurt you if I am like that?

406
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,918
If you are different, it doesn't hurt Me at all!

407
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,117
If you know one work of say,

408
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,838
organizing this or that, I don't feel bad.

409
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:37,387
Why should you feel bad if somebody is a Divine Personality?

410
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:40,854
Why did you feel bad that Christ was a Divine
Personality?

411
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:42,315
Why did you murder Him?

412
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:43,629
Why did you kill Him?

413
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,921
Why did you torture all the people,

414
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,968
who were such saintly people?

415
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,517
You were very wise and sweet, isn't it?

416
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:54,182
You have been very kind and nice people,

417
00:22:54,296 --> 00:23:00,785
running after all kinds of wrong type of useless misguiding people.

418
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,222
There are so many, now, who have come to misguide you.

419
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:11,176
They are taking money for you for misguiding you!

420
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,928
They are taking money for giving you sins.

421
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:20,883
They are nicely, booking you up for a trip to hell,

422
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:23,875
they themselves are booked nicely there.

423
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:29,548
And when I say, about them, people feel very hurt that why should Mataji

424
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:31,453
talk against these gurus?

425
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,594
They are not gurus, they are rakshasas!

426
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,060
Once Christ stood up and said

427
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:45,663
"These devils and the children of devil will have to go to hell!"

428
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:47,644
Then people got after Him, they said,

429
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,559
"Why do you say such things against them?"

430
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:53,335
They don't say anything against each other.

431
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:56,360
Christ said "The Satan is not going to speak

432
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,799
against his own house."

433
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,599
They are very friendly with each other.

434
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,009
There is no problem among them.

435
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:10,320
They are very kind to each other, now all the disciples

436
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,509
are being distributed: "You take such a lot,

437
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:15,681
 I take such a lot and all of us will go to hell directly."

438
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,614
It's properly organized

439
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:20,732
 like one train is going first then the second train will leave,

440
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:23,306
then the third train will leave.

441
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:28,120
The other side of this kind of ambitiousness and the kind

442
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,899
of ego-orientation and money-orientation

443
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:33,937
we have, all the time we are busy with this money!

444
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:38,033
I call it a ‘bhrama’, call it a hallucination.

445
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,762
It's a big hallucination with you people,

446
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,065
that you are running after money.

447
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,020
It's another hallucination that you are running

448
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,037
after pretaatmas (bhoots) and dead bodies.

449
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:51,676
These are two mirages you are running after.

450
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,995
What are you going to get out of this money?

451
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,577
Go and see somebody who is supposed to be

452
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:00,437
a very, very rich man!

453
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:03,944
Just go and see - is he a happy man?

454
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:06,800
What is the analysis of his life?

455
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:10,495
So-called successful people, you just go and see them,

456
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:13,002
what is the success they have?

457
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:14,499
Who respects them?

458
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,789
When they turn their back,

459
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,267
people say "Oh God, whose face have I seen let me go and

460
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:19,780
wash my mouth!"

461
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:22,908
Are you auspicious?

462
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,304
If somebody sees you, does any

463
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,516
good comes out of you, some  ‘shubha’ (auspiciousness)

464
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,753
happens to that person?

465
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,120
Are you ‘kalyanamay’ (full of benevolence)?

466
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,524
Are you ‘mangalmay’ (full of auspiciousness)?

467
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:37,188
What sort of a personality are you,

468
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,903
just judge yourself, and that judgment can take place,

469
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,855
here in Sahaja Yoga.

470
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,886
We had a patient who came to Sahaja Yoga,

471
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,629
and he told Me "Mother, I'm a young boy, but

472
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,476
I don't know what has happened to me,

473
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,199
that I have become inauspicious." I said, "How do you know?"

474
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,610
He said, "Wherever I go there's a quarrel between husband and wife;

475
00:25:56,719 --> 00:26:00,033
something goes wrong with the children; the children start crying

476
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:02,334
and shouting and screaming.

477
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:07,864
And now I'm hated by everyone, everybody says 'there is something wrong with you.'"

478
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,676
I found out about him, what was the matter

479
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:16,096
- he got cured. Now he is emitting beautiful vibrations.

480
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,315
You can have very negative vibrations going out of you,

481
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,102
you might be, doing sins without your knowledge and you would say,

482
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,231
"Oh, Mother, I'm getting all the vibrations, I'm very good."

483
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,992
Such people always deceive, themselves and others, very good at it.

484
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,873
"Oh, nothing wrong with me, I'm in

485
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:36,287
first class condition, my vibrations are the best" and,

486
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,702
that "I'm doing very well".

487
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:42,829
Who is going to judge you is your deed.

488
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,688
What good have you done to others?

489
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,560
Recently we had a mishap like that.

490
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:51,106
And I found all those people who were touched by that gentleman,

491
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,961
had left Swadisthana catching. Very bad!

492
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,677
And when I told them that this was a wrong thing to do, is to make this man so important,

493
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,627
they all got after my life.

494
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:05,625
There was a doctor who had come to see Me, who is a Sahaja Yogi.

495
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:08,346
His son came to see Me, he is eight year old,

496
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,406
and a very good boy, had a realization, but

497
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,314
he had a very bad Swadisthana.

498
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:14,617
So I asked him "Does this man come to your house?"

499
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:16,442
He says, "Yes Mother, he comes very often."

500
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,396
Despite My warning he would go to their house
and they would entertain that gentleman.

501
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,764
Instead of telling him that "You go to Mother
and get yourself cleared out!"

502
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,003
You see they are enticed and hypnotized by such a person.

503
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,602
I asked him, I said, "Have you got

504
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,214
this man coming to your house?"

505
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:33,332
"Yes", he said.
I said, "All right!

506
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:36,243
Go and beat him with shoes, as we do in our Sahaja Yoga."

507
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:38,522
And the boy got cleared out.

508
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,891
Do you want to ruin your family, your children,

509
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:43,243
everybody, because you're adhering to some

510
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:44,773
hypnotic fellow?

511
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:49,033
At least have some consideration for them!

512
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,090
There are many like this, but in Sahaja Yoga

513
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:54,471
it is very easy to desert, and even in London

514
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,360
I know who is going where, what they are doing.

515
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:59,625
I write to them, I tell them, "Don't do it!

516
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,881
Just don't do it, have nothing to do!"

517
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,296
Immediately you must understand,

518
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:06,109
that - Our Mother who knows these things.

519
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:08,903
She knows and if She has told us

520
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,465
 it is the thing that is to be done. Not to be argued!

521
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,104
Did you get your vibrations through arguments?

522
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,250
But still in Sahaja Yoga also people falter,

523
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:21,857
and that's the worst thing they will do, because

524
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:24,908
yogabhrashtas are the most condemned.

525
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,754
Where will they go?

526
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:32,213
I have to warn, 
all the Sahaja Yogis who are here,

527
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,138
because Sahaja Yoga is the Last Judgement!

528
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,126
Not only that you will be judged,

529
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:41,164
that you are entering into the Kingdom of God, that

530
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:43,572
you become the citizens of God - is correct.

531
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:47,590
But apart from that, that you are capable of being there,

532
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,626
whether you have the complete

533
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,566
surrendering and understanding of divine laws.

534
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,037
Even if you are belonging, to say,

535
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:58,097
India and a citizen of India, but if you do

536
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,480
mistakes and if you commit criminal laws you'll be punished.

537
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:02,571
Even then!

538
00:29:02,651 --> 00:29:05,134
So, even if you become the citizen of God,

539
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,309
you have to be very very careful about it!

540
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:13,245
The second thing, I would like to tell you,

541
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:17,871
is about the destroying powers of Kalki.

542
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:20,696
Today's lecture is going to be very sharp for you,

543
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,224
because the incarnation that you

544
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:26,423
have asked Me to speak on is a very sharp one,

545
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:28,543
is the sharpest of all.

546
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,911
We had, say, Krishna's incarnation

547
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,957
when He had Hanana Shakti (Killing power).

548
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:36,382
He has killed Kamsa, He has killed

549
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:39,726
so many rakshasas, you know as child also, He has

550
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:42,266
killed Putana, and so many people.

551
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,729
But, He had leela also.

552
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:52,662
He had love and He did

553
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,710
give concessions to people, He forgave people also.

554
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,961
But Christ, who is the embodiment of forgiveness,

555
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:05,861
forgiveness of Christ is nothing, but is the

556
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,202
power of sustenance within Him.

557
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,947
If He explodes...

558
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,816
the whole forgiveness can come on us,

559
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:17,760
as a big disaster if we are not able to understand

560
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:20,039
the value of His forgiveness.

561
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,910
He has said very clearly, that

562
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:27,615
"Anything said against Me will be tolerated but a word against

563
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,974
Holy Ghost won't be tolerated."

564
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,717
He has clearly said it!

565
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:36,597
And now you have to understand that Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti.

566
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:41,812
One has to understand that such an incarnation is imminent.

567
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,107
And Krishna's powers, are given to Him,

568
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,222
which are only Hanana Shakti.

569
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:51,127
Brahmadeva’s powers,

570
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:54,155
which are only Hanana Shakti are given to Him.

571
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:56,883
Shiva's powers, which are just Hanana Shakti,

572
00:30:56,966 --> 00:31:00,024
the part of it which is a 
Tandava (dance of dissolution), is given to Him.

573
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,375
Then Bhairava's shakti, which is also,

574
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:08,309
you know what Bhairava has got as a symbol of

575
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:11,036
killing, is a big sword-like thing,

576
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:17,341
and also Ganesha's Parusha; and also Hanumana's all

577
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:21,695
Navasidhis, which are going to destroy, are given to Him.

578
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,136
All Buddha's forgiveness,

579
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:32,295
and Mahavira's Ahimsa is going to turn upside-down.

580
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:35,887
All these eleven powers are going to come

581
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:39,549
on top of us when we will be

582
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:45,170
finished with Sahaja Yoga, when we will be absolutely sorted out,

583
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,447
and the last killing will be done by Him.

584
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,442
I wish it was just a killing it is not going to be

585
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,911
ordinary Hanana (killing) like even
Devi has done.

586
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,399
Because Devi has killed all these rakshasas

587
00:31:57,502 --> 00:31:59,303
thousands of years back, but they are back

588
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:01,617
in the seat again, all these rakshasas.

589
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,256
Now the problem is very different,

590
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:07,248
at the present moment, which you should try to understand.

591
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:10,583
That in the olden days, till the Krishna's time when He says,

592
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:16,250
that "Yada yada hi dharmasya, glanir bhawati bharata.

593
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,448
Vinashaya cha dushkruthaam panitra na echa
saguna."

594
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:24,990
These two words you must understand.

595
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:31,438
To destroy the Dushkruthaam, means the cruel people

596
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:35,588
or the negative forces, and to save the saints.

597
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:40,680
"Sambhavami yuge yuge", "I'm going to come again and again".

598
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,945
But the problem of the Kaliyuga is that there is no

599
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,672
pure and simple person as a sadhu or as a rakshasa.

600
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:53,462
So many rakshasas have entered into your brains.

601
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,822
You side with so many people who are wrong,

602
00:32:57,457 --> 00:33:00,506
who are doing wrong, who are doing all kinds

603
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:02,831
of wrong things in the name of politics, in

604
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:07,150
the name of religion, in the name of progress

605
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,497
and education and all that.

606
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,456
Once you have sided with them,

607
00:33:11,513 --> 00:33:14,063
then they are in your brain, they are within you.

608
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:17,291
And when they are within you,

609
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,352
how to destroy the dushkruthaams?

610
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,018
They are within you!

611
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,775
You may be a good person,

612
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:27,721
but you may be destroyed because of having them in your heads.

613
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:31,065
So there is no hard and fast rule as to say

614
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,818
who is a real negative and who is a real positive.

615
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,150
Only the Sahaja Yoga is going to cleanse you

616
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:41,017
and make you absolutely positive, positively

617
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:44,391
good people, and religious people.

618
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:49,074
This is the only way, because your ankura, when it starts

619
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:51,069
giving you realization,

620
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:54,431
you feel your Self, you feel your Self,

621
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:57,436
and with that Self you know

622
00:33:57,526 --> 00:34:01,415
that you are your Self and not this mirage.

623
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,389
You start enjoying that Self.

624
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,202
Once you start enjoying it, you give up all these things

625
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:08,174
that make you compromise and

626
00:34:08,277 --> 00:34:11,770
make you a horribly mixed-up person.

627
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,955
All this confusion can go away!

628
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:17,389
So it is essential that we should

629
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,735
take to Sahaja Yoga in the most dedicated manner,

630
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:23,476
and redeem ourselves of our all wrong doings

631
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:26,250
and also others whom we know and this is the

632
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:29,665
only thing that we can give to our friends, relations

633
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,469
and all the world around!

634
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,434
People invite others for dinners, have drinks, this, that.

635
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:37,090
What do you give them?

636
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:38,362
Nothing?!

637
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:44,108
They will give presents on a birthday they'll

638
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,022
go round and give garlands and exchange good

639
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:48,416
wishes and everything.

640
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,282
There in London when there's a Christmas day,

641
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:54,083
the cards pile up to such an extent that no

642
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:57,711
letter can be sent for ten days before Christmas.

643
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,655
And where is Christ?

644
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:03,665
On the Day when Christ is born they'll go in for a champagne.

645
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:07,596
Such foolish people, even somebody dies they'll go for a Champagne.

646
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:13,299
Champagne is their religion now, and whisky is their Kundalini.

647
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:17,989
They cannot understand God.

648
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:21,306
How can they, when they have made God according to their own

649
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:23,270
conception of falsehood?

650
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:28,003
As a Mother, I have to warn you, be careful.

651
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:31,046
Do not play about with your Self.

652
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:36,591
Do not go down, but come up, come up and come up.

653
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:38,381
I'm here to help you.

654
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:41,136
I'm here to work for you day and night,

655
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:43,871
that you know I work very hard for you.

656
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:46,015
I'll spare no efforts,

657
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:49,122
to help you and do everything that is possible,

658
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:50,878
to make you all right

659
00:35:51,036 --> 00:35:53,548
 to pass this examination of Last Judgment.

660
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:55,574
But you have to cooperate with Me

661
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:58,706
and you have to go headlong about it and devote most

662
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,727
of your time for Sahaja Yoga

663
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:04,910
and for imbibing all that is great and noble.

664
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,738
Kalki is a very big subject,

665
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,833
and, if you see the Kalki Purana, is such big book, of course

666
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,010
lot of trash is also in there.

667
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,297
But, when is the time coming, if people say,

668
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,337
we'll say this is a living process.

669
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,437
When the work will be finished,

670
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,136
when we will see that there's no more chance of having

671
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:30,095
any more people in this life, Kalki will come down.

672
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,872
Let us see how many come in, but there is a limit, also, of that.

673
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:39,631
So, I would request you, to go out, call your friends,

674
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:43,373
call your relations, call your neighbours, all of them.

675
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:46,915
Tomorrow is the last day of My program here of Navaratri,

676
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,845
where we are going to have a little felicitation from the Mother.

677
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,456
To Me the greatest felicitations will be when in this Bombay,

678
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,594
I will find more people realized, taking to Sahaja Yoga seriously.

679
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:05,142
And after coming to Sahaja Yoga not to indulge
in

680
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,816
backbiting, and small petty-mindedness

681
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:13,727
and getting angry with each other, but being sensible and wise.

682
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:17,404
It is most surprising those who are supposed to be

683
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:21,248
the cream of the nation, the most sophisticated

684
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,520
people, are so petty-minded and useless.

685
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:30,839
I have to tell you these things because of the

686
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:35,147
immediate emergency that is coming forward before Me.

687
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:37,319
And I am only praying that

688
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:41,015
it should not be in Bombay that it should start.

689
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:44,372
Bombay had gone into the verge, if you remember,

690
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:48,861
the day when Rajesh Shah phoned Me that, "Mother,

691
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,482
what about rain, what about rain, what about rain?"

692
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:53,136
I wouldn't answer him,

693
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:56,380
till he said: "Mother, I know you are angry with Bombay people,

694
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:59,022
but still forgive them, once again!"

695
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:02,491
And that is the night when you started getting all this rain.

696
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:06,009
Next calamity, beware of it.

697
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:09,591
I have to tell all Bombay people, every time
I come back,

698
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:12,254
I find this kind of a nonsense of these Sahaja Yogis,

699
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,625
getting after one man somewhere and getting lost.

700
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,825
And the another thing is that Bombay people are still most

701
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:23,239
unaware of what is going to fall into them.

702
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:27,490
Most unaware how they are made from amoeba to this stage,

703
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,644
what God has done for them

704
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:32,257
and what they have to do for God.

705
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:34,548
It's a very very sad affair,

706
00:38:34,662 --> 00:38:38,198
extremely sad, for the whole of the country because people

707
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:40,265
try to follow this Bombay.

708
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:43,224
There are so many people who would like to

709
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:48,674
follow an actor and an actress than to follow
God.

710
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:53,377
This is the trouble, with our superficial temperaments.

711
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:59,069
I have to say that we have tomorrow a very good program,

712
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,522
 and also a book has been written "The Advent"

713
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:07,609
 by Grégoire de Kalbermatten,

714
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,801
who is a son of a baron and a Swiss boy,

715
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,071
and when he came to Me I could see clearly that he's a seeker,

716
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:20,234
though he was a gone-case, he was like a schizophrenic person.

717
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:22,635
He was absolutely a gone-case, but I could see in him,

718
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,196
that there's a big seeker within him,

719
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,429
 and I had to work hard with him for a year

720
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:31,174
to bring him round to his normal senses.

721
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,896
But when there is not even seeking within you

722
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:37,909
and when you go that astray, what is going to happen to you?

723
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:39,178
I don't know.

724
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,274
So be careful, be very very careful.

725
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,482
Today is the day of warning you,

726
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,157
because you have asked Me to talk about Kalki.

727
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:50,524
He is placed on our forehead.

728
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:54,438
When the Kalki is caught-up

729
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:58,055
-the chakra of Kalki is caught-up - the whole of murdha (brain),

730
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,118
on top, goes out of order.

731
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:01,898
In the Kundalini awakening,

732
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:05,006
we find that the murdha is all out of order, it doesn't rise.

733
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:07,944
The whole head becomes a blockade.

734
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:11,698
Such people do not allow the Kundalini to rise above,

735
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:14,056
the, we can say, the Hamsa chakra.

736
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:17,216
At the most they might try to raise up to Agnya,

737
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:18,792
but the Kundalini falls down.

738
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,592
Of course one of the reasons as I said that if you,

739
00:40:21,683 --> 00:40:25,753
put your forehead before wrong gurus, also, you suffer.

740
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:29,661
But too much thinking also creates 
a problem on the right-hand-side here,

741
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:34,110
and one of the aspects of Kalki gets spoilt

742
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:37,496
and there is an imbalance is created, on this side.

743
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:44,165
The whole forehead, if it is full of lots of bumps,

744
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:48,213
then one must know that the Kalki chakra is out of order.

745
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:50,819
If the Kalki chakra is out of order,

746
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:56,221
the person is about to go into some sort of a very bad

747
00:40:56,823 --> 00:41:00,886
calamity, is a sign of a person who is going
to get.

748
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:04,006
When the Kalki chakra is caught-up all your

749
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:05,979
fingers start burning.

750
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:10,312
On the hands and on the palm,

751
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:13,566
sometimes even in the body, you get terrible burning.

752
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:16,053
A person's Kalki chakra catching means,

753
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:19,772
he might be down with a horrible disease like

754
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:21,870
cancer, maybe leprosy.

755
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,125
Maybe any such diseases,

756
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:28,688
or maybe that he is about to collapse into some sort of a calamity.

757
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,370
So Kalki chakra must be kept all right in balance.

758
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:35,569
At least there are eleven sub-chakras of the Kalki chakra.

759
00:41:35,714 --> 00:41:39,022
And out of them, at least try to keep some of them alive,

760
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:40,725
so that the others can be rescued.

761
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,900
But if all the chakras are ruined,

762
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:46,194
then it is very difficult to give you realization.

763
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:51,602
What is the thing one should do, to keep your Kalki all right?

764
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,160
To keep your Kalki all right you must have that awe for God.

765
00:41:56,393 --> 00:41:58,828
If you do not have awe for God,

766
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:02,603
if you are not afraid of God, if you are not afraid,

767
00:42:02,776 --> 00:42:06,538
that if you do wrong He is there with His wrath

768
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,375
and that He is a wrathful God,

769
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,038
and that He is full of poison for us,

770
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:18,437
if we try to do anything wrong, if there is no fear of that.

771
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,524
Not that it is to be hidden from Me,

772
00:42:20,627 --> 00:42:23,985
or from anybody else but not - you yourself know that

773
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:26,604
you are doing wrong. If you are doing something wrong,

774
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,019
and you know in your hearts of hearts that "I am doing

775
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:30,750
something wrong," please, don't do it!

776
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:32,794
Otherwise your Kalki will go out.

777
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,596
When you have that awe for God,

778
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:41,174
and you know that God is All-pervading, He is All-powerful,

779
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:43,728
He has powers to raise us,

780
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:48,285
to this state of higher being and also He has power to bestow

781
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,292
all the blessings that He has.

782
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:53,083
He is the most compassionate God,

783
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:57,154
or we can say the most compassionate Father, that one can think of.

784
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,840
But in the same way He has a wrath.

785
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:05,097
And that wrath, when it falls upon you - be
very very careful!

786
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:06,979
As a Mother I have to warn you

787
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:09,791
- Be careful about the wrath of your Father,

788
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,539
because if He comes on you with that wrath,

789
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:14,591
nobody can stop it.

790
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:18,752
Nobody can stop it and the compassion of Mother

791
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:22,096
also, will not be listened to because He may

792
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:23,919
say that "You have spoiled your children by

793
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,323
giving them too much looseness".

794
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:31,527
So I have to tell you, that please don't do anything that is wrong,

795
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,201
and do not, make Me feel bad about it.

796
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:38,607
Because, for a Mother it is very difficult to tell these things.

797
00:43:38,988 --> 00:43:41,120
It's very hard, for a

798
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:44,080
Mother, who has a tender heart and a kind heart for you,

799
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:45,509
to say all these things.

800
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:47,912
But I have to request you that don't play about

801
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,364
because your Father is full of wrath,

802
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:54,345
and He can punish you if you do anything wrong.

803
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:56,124
But if you do anything

804
00:43:56,226 --> 00:44:00,965
for Him or for your own being, for in your self realization,

805
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:03,642
you will be placed in the highest position.

806
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,864
Today you may be the biggest millionaire,

807
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:07,404
you may be the richest man,

808
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:08,903
you may be the greatest

809
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,490
political leader, you may be the

810
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,803
prime minister and all that nonsense

811
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:16,475
- in the presence of God, those who are dear to God

812
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:18,776
will be placed at the highest positions

813
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:21,225
and not all these worldly things which look

814
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:24,569
so interesting and enchanting to you.

815
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:26,745
The most important thing,

816
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:30,827
where are you as far as far as God is concerned, that relation

817
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,466
you must establish by first finding out your Self,

818
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:38,514
your Atma, through Sahaja Yoga, and then relating yourself to that.

819
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:40,049
May God bless you all!

820
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,699
Now we'll have a session of Sahaja Yoga

821
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:45,846
for you to get corrected, and I would like those

822
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:48,607
people who have not been here before to come forward,

823
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:52,200
to get their realization, and all the Sahaja Yogis to help Me today,

824
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:58,494
because today being Kalki's day, vibrations have been bit too much!
